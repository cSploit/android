  * Locale-free patch by Yusuke Endoh [ruby-core:17444].

=== 1.2.0 / 2008-06-21

New features:

* RubyGems no longer performs bulk updates and instead only fetches the gemspec
  files it needs.  Alternate sources will need to upgrade to RubyGems 1.2 to
  allow RubyGems to take advantage of the new metadata updater.  If a pre 1.2
  remote source is in the sources list, RubyGems will revert to the bulk update
  code for compatibility.
* RubyGems now has runtime and development dependency types.  Use
  #add_development_dependency and #add_runtime_dependency.  All typeless
  dependencies are considered to be runtime dependencies.
* RubyGems will now require rubygems/defaults/operating_system.rb and
  rubygems/defaults/#{RBX_ENGINE}.rb if they exist.  This allows packagers and
  ruby implementers to add custom behavior to RubyGems via these files.  (If
  the RubyGems API is insufficient, please suggest improvements via the
  RubyGems list.)
* /etc/gemrc (and windows equivalent) for global settings
* setup.rb now handles --vendor and --destdir for packagers

* Gem.default_path is now honored if GEM_PATH is not set, patch #19502

Other Changes Include:

* setup.rb
  * stub files created by RubyGems 0.7.x and older are no longer removed.  When
    upgrading from these ancient versions, upgrade to 1.1.x first to clean up
    stubs.
  * RDoc is no longer required until necessary, patch #20414
* `gem server`
  * Now completely matches the output of `gem generate_index` and
    has correct content types
  * Refreshes from source directories for every hit.  The server will no longer
    need to be restarted after installing gems.
* `gem query --details` and friends now display author, homepage, rubyforge url
  and installed location
* `gem install` without -i no longer reinstalls dependencies if they are in
  GEM_PATH but not in GEM_HOME
* Gem::RemoteFetcher now performs persistent connections for HEAD requests,
  bug #7973

Bugs Fixed:

* Gem.prefix now returns non-nil only when RubyGems was installed outside
  sitelibdir or libdir.

=== 1.1.0 / 2008-03-29

New features:

* RubyGems now uses persistent connections on index updates.  Index updates are
  much faster now.
* RubyGems only updates from a latest index by default, cutting candidate gems
  for updates to roughly 1/4 (at present).  Index updates are even faster
  still.
  * `gem list -r` may only show the latest version of a gem, add --all to see
    all gems.
* `gem spec` now extracts specifications from .gem files.
* `gem query --installed` to aid automation of checking for gems.

Bugs Fixed:

=== 0.9.4 / 2007-05-23

If you are experiencing problems with the source index (e.g. strange
"No Method" errors), or problems with zlib (e.g. "Buffer Error"
messsage), we recommend upgrading to RubyGems 0.9.4.

Bug Fixes Include:

* Several people have been experiencing problems with no method errors
  on the source index cache.  The source index cache is now a bit more
  self healing.  Furthermore, if the source index cache is
  irreparable, then it is automatically dropped and reloaded.
* The source cache files may now be dropped with the "gem sources
  --clear-all" command.  (This command may require root is the system
  source cache is in a root protected area).
* Several sub-commands were accidently dropped from the "gem" command.
  These commands have been restored.

=== 0.9.3 / 2007-05-10

Bug Fixes Include:

The ZLib library on Windows will occasionally complains about a buffer error
when unpacking gems.  The Gems software has a workaround for that problem, but
the workaround was only enabled for versions of ZLib 1.2.1 or earlier.  We
have received several reports of the error occuring with ZLib 1.2.3, so we
have permanently enabled the work around on all versions.

=== 0.9.2 / 2007-02-05

Bug Fixes Include:

* The "unpack" command now works properly.
* User name and password are now passed properly to the authenticating
  proxy when downloading gems.

=== 0.9.1 / 2007-01-16

See ChangeLog

=== 0.9.0 / 2006-06-28

Finally, the much anticipated RubyGems version 0.9.0 is now available.
This release includes a number of new features and bug fixes.  The
number one change is that we can now download the gem index
incrementally.  This will greatly speed up the gem command when only a
few gems are out of date.

Major Enhancments include:

* The gem index is now downloaded incrementally, only updating entries
  that are out of date.  If more than 50 entries are out of date, we
  revert back to a bulk download.
* Several patches related to allowing RubyGems to work with
  authenticating proxies (from Danie Roux and Anatol Pomozov).  Just
  put the user and password in the proxy URL (e.g. -p
  http://user:password@proxy.address.com:8080) or use the
  HTTP_PROXY_USER and HTTP_PROXY_PASS environment variables.
* The gem unpack command can now accept a file path rather than just a
  install gem name.
* Both RI and RDOC documents are now generated by default.
* A gemri command is included to read gem RI docs (only needed for
  Ruby 1.8.4 or earlier).

Minor enhancements include:

* Verison 0.0.0 is now a valid gem version.
* Better detection of missing SSL functionality.
* SSL is not required if the security policy does not require
  signature checking.
* Rake built extensions are now supported (Tilman Sauerbeck).
* Several autorequire bug fixes.
* --traceback is now an alias for --backtrace (I can never remember
  which one it is).
* SAFE=1 compatibility fixes.
* .rbw is now a supported suffix for RubyGem's custom require.
* Several Ruby 1.9 compatibility fixes (Eric Hodel).

Bug Fixes:

* Added dashes to gemspecs generated in Ruby 1.8.3.  This solves some
  cross-Ruby version compatibility issues.
* Fixed bug where the wrong executables could be uninstalled (Eric
  Hodel).
* Fixed bug where gem unpack occasionally unpacked the wrong gem.
* Fixed bug where a fatal error occured when permissions on .gemrc
  were too restrictive (reported by Luca Pireddu).
* Fixed prefix handling for native expressions (patch by Aaron Patterson).
* Fixed several Upgrade => Update typos.

=== 0.8.11 / 2005-07-13

* -y is a synonym for --include-dependencies.
* Better handling of errors in the top level rescue clause.
* Package list command (e.g. gem inspect GEM).
* .gemrc now allows cvsrc-like options to set defaults per subcommand.
* The autorequire gem spec field will now accept a list.
* Substituted Time for Date in specs, increasing performance
  dramatically.
* Fixed reported bug of gem directories ending in "-" (reported by
  Erik Hatcher).
* Fixed but in installer that caused dependency installation to not
  work.
* Added Paul Duncan's gem signing patch.
* Added Mark Hubbart's Framework patch (for better integration with OS
  X).
* Added David Glasser's install-from-mirror patch.
* Additional internal structural cleanup and test reorganization.

=== 0.8.10 / 2005-03-27

* In multi-user environments, it is common to supply mulitple versions of gems
  (for example Rails), allowing individual users to select the version of the
  gem they desire.  This allows a user to be insulated from updates to that
  gem.  RubyGems 0.8.10 fixes a problem where gems could occasionally become
  confused about the current versions of libraries selected by the user.
* The other annoying bug is that if there are any existing rubygems-update gems
  installed, then the "gem update --system" command will download a new
  update, but install the latest update prior to the download.

=== 0.8.9

Never released

=== 0.8.8 / 2005-03-14

* Moved the master definition of class Requirement back under version.
  Kept the body of Requirement under Gem.

=== 0.8.7 / 2005-03-14

Even though it has only been a few weeks since that last release,
there are quite a number of new features in 0.8.7.  A complete list of
new features will be given below, but here is a summary of the hot
items.

* The bug that prevented some users from installing rails has been
  squashed.  A big thanks to Bill Guindon (aGorilla) for helping track
  that one down.

There are several new commands available on the gem command:

* gem cleanup GEMNAME -- Cleanup (uninstall) all the old versions of
  gem.  If the gem name is omitted, the entire repository is cleaned.
* gem dependency GEMNAME -- Show the dependencies for the named gems.
  This is really helpful when trying to figure out what gem needs what
  other gem.

There changes to the existing commands as well.

* gem uninstall is much smarter about removing gems from the
  repository.  Lists of gems are now uninstalled in proper dependency
  order (ie. if A depends on B, A is uninstalled first).  Also,
  warnings about broken dependencies occur only when removing the
  *last* gem that supports a dependency is removed.

Both gem install and gem uninstall support some new command line
options that can reduce the amount of yes/no queries given the user.
For install we have:

* --ignore-dependencies -- Only install requests gems, no
  dependendecies are automatically installed.
* --include-dependencies -- Automatically install dependencies,
  without confirmation.

For gem uninstall, the new options are:

* --all -- Uninstall all matching gems without confirmation.
* --ignore-dependencies -- Uninstall, even if dependencies are broken.
* --executables -- Remove executables without confirmation

Under general cleanup, gems will not, by default, run RDoc on packages
that do not have the RDoc flag set.

And finally there is a new library file 'gemconfigure' to aid in
writing version sensitive applications (without undue dependencies on
RubyGems); and 'gemwhich', a short script to locate libraries in the
file system.  You can read more about them here:

* gemconfigure: http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/4#page73
* gemwhich: http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/17

=== 0.8.6 / 2005-02-27

* Fixed a small bug with shebang construction

=== 0.8.5 / 2005-02-26

installing gems?

  Updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org

It could take up to 30 seconds (on my machine, even worse on others) for
that crazy source index to update.

This latest release of RubyGems speeds that wait time up considerably.
The following table gives the following times for installing RedCloth
with a required source index update on three system we had available to
us.  No RDoc generation was included in the following times.

  RubyGems    Linux         Mac OSX      Windows
  0.8.4       33 secs       73 secs      58 secs
  0.8.5        8 secs       14 secs      21 secs

The new caching code is at least 3x faster than previous versions.  Woo
Hoo!

=== 0.8.4 / 2005-01-01

* Rubygems 0.8.3's installer was broken unless you already had an older
  version of RubyGems installed.  That's fixed.
* Change in the way Gem::Specification internally deals with lazy attributes
  and defaults, bringing (with some loadpath_manager changes) a fairly
  significant increase in speed.
* Support for lower-cased Gem file names (for you, Paul Duncan :)
* Erik Veenstra's patch for making Gem versions sortable.

=== 0.8.3 / 2004-12-07

No real earth shattering news here, but there were a number of really
annoying issues involving other libraries that RubyGems depends upon.
0.8.3 contains some workarounds for these issues.  In particular:

* Added workaround for the null byte in Dir string issue. (see
  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121702).
  (Thanks to Mauricio Fernández for the quick response on this one).
* Added workaround for old version of Zlib on windows that caused
  Ruwiki to fail to install. (see
  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121770)
* Added workaround for large YAML file issues.  (We dynamically cut
  down the size of the source index YAML file and seem to have worked
  around immediate issues.

There has been some minor usability enhancements and changes ...

* A user specific source index cache can be used when the site-wide
  cache is unwritable (i.e. because you are running as a non-admin).
  This *greatly* speeds up gem commands run in non-admin mode when the
  site-wide cache is out of date.
* The gem command now used an HTTP HEAD command to detect if the
  server's source index needs to be downloaed.
* gem check gemname --test will run unit tests on installed gems that
  have unit tests.
* Multiple gem names are allowed on the gem install command line.
  This means you can do:
  
    gem install rake rails needle postgres-pr pimki
  
  (Ok, you get the idea)
* Multiple authors my be specified in a Gem spec.
* Switched to using setup.rb (rather than a custom install script) for
  the installation of RubyGems itself.  If you have installed RubyGems
  before, double check the installation instructions and make sure you
  use setup.rb instead of install.rb.
* Ryan Davis has provided a patch so you can use an env variable
  (GEM_SKIP), to tell loadpath_manager not to load gems of those
  names.  This was useful for him while testing libs that he had in
  development.

=== 0.8.1 / 2009-09-14

* Quick release to capture some bug fixes.

=== 0.8.0 / 2009-09-12

* Remove need for library stubs.  Set the RUBYOPT environment variable to
  include "rrubygems", and a normal require will find gem files.  Continue to
  use 'require_gem gem_name, version' to specify gem versions.
* Deprecated "test_suite_file" gemspec attribute in favor of "test_files" array.
* Generates rdoc by default on installs.
* Adopted tar/gzip file format, thanks to Mauricio Fernandez.
* "gem rdoc" allows generation of rdoc after gem installation (will add a "gem
  test"
* Application stubs can now accept an optional parameter of _VERSION_ that will
  run an arbitrary version of the application requested.
* Various bug fixes
* Various platform-independency improvements
* "gem spec --all" displays spec info for all installed version of a given gem.
* Dynamic caching of sources
* Support for user-definable sources on the command line (thanks Assaph Mehr)
* More intelligent support for platform-dependent gems.  Use Platform::CURRENT
  when building a gem to set its platform to the one you're building on.
  Installation displays a choice of platform-dependent gems, allowing the user
  to pick.
* Added "gem unpack" for "unpacking" a gem to the current directory

=== 0.7.0 / 2004-07-09

See ChangeLog

=== 0.6.0 / 2004-06-08

* Collapse output of --search and --list (and gem_server) operations so that
  each gem is listed only once, with each of its versions listed on the same
  line.
* bin/gem: new --upgrade-all option allows one to upgrade every installed gem
* new #required_ruby_version attribute added to gem specification for
  specifying a dependency on which version of ruby the gem needs.  Format it
  accepts is the same as the Gem::Version::Requirement format:
  
    spec.required_ruby_version = "> 1.8.0"
* --install-stub defaults to true, so library stubs are created

=== 0.5.0 / 2004-06-06

* Jim added the ability to specify version constraints to avoid API
  incompatibilities.  This has been the subject of much debate for the past
  couple of months, with many ideas and code contributed by Eivind Eklund and
  Mauricio Fernandez.  The following set of assertions shows how it works:
  
    assert_inadequate("1.3", "~> 1.4")
    assert_adequate(  "1.4", "~> 1.4")
    assert_adequate(  "1.5", "~> 1.4")
    assert_inadequate("2.0", "~> 1.4") # This one is key--the new operator
				       # disallows major version number
				       # differences.
* Group gem search output when multiple versions exist for a given gem:
  
    activerecord (0.7.8, 0.7.7, 0.7.6, 0.7.5)
      Implements the ActiveRecord pattern for ORM.
* Add arbitrary RDoc-able files via gemspec (not just Ruby source files) for
  people who have, for example, README.rdoc in their distributions.  Add to
  gemspec via: spec.extra_rdoc_files = ["list", "of", "files"].  Ruby files are
  automatically included.
* Some small bug fixes

=== 0.4.0 / 2004-05-31

* Minor bug fixes including Windows compatability issues

=== 0.3.0 / 2004-04-30

* Cleanup of command-line arguments and handling.  Most commands accept a
  --local or --remote modifier.
* Creation of Application Gems (packages that include executable programs).
  See http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?DeveloperGuide for information
  on how to use it.
* Basic functionality for installing binary gems from source (:extensions
  property of gem specification holds an array of paths to extconf.rb files to
  be used for compilation)
* Install library "stub" allowing a normal 'require' to work (which then does
  the rubygems require and 'require_gem'
* --run-tests runs the test suite specified by the "test_suite_file" property
  of a gem specification
* HTTP Proxy support works.  Rewrite of HTTP code.
* Unit and functional tests added (see Rakefile).
* Prompt before remote-installing dependencies during gem installation.
* Config file for storing preferences for 'gem' command usage.
* Generally improved error messages (still more work to do)
* Rearranged gem directory structure for cleanliness.

=== 0.2.0 / 2004-03-14

* Initial public release
