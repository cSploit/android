= How to build ruby using Visual C++

== Requirement

(1) Visual C++ 6.0 or later.

    Note: if you want to build x64 or ia64 version, use native compiler for
          x64/ia64.

(2) Please set environment variable (({INCLUDE})), (({LIB})), (({PATH}))
    to run required commands properly from the command line.

    Note: building ruby requires following commands.
     * nmake
     * cl
     * lib
     * dumpbin

(3) If you want to build from SVN source, following commands are required.
     * bison
     * sed
     * ruby 1.8

(4) If you want built binaries to run on Windows 95 series (including
    98 and Me), you need unicows.lib at compile time, and unicows.dll
    at run time.

== How to compile and install

(1) Execute win32\configure.bat on your build directory.
    You can specify the target platform as an argument.
    For example, run `((%configure --target=i686-mswin32%))'
    You can also specify the install directory.
    For example, run `((%configure --prefix=<install_directory>%))'
    Default of the install directory is /usr .
    The default ((|<PLATFORM>|)) is `(({i386-mswin32}))'.

(2) Change ((|RUBY_INSTALL_NAME|)) and ((|RUBY_SO_NAME|)) in (({Makefile}))
    if you want to change the name of the executable files. 
    And add ((|RUBYW_INSTALL_NAME|)) to change the name of the
    executable without console window if also you want.

(3) Run `((%nmake%))'

(4) Run `((%nmake test%))'

(5) Run `((%nmake install%))'

== Icons

Any icon files(*.ico) in the build directory, directories specified with
((|icondirs|)) make variable and (({win32})) directory under the ruby
source directory will be included in DLL or executable files, according
to their base names.
    $(RUBY_INSTALL_NAME).ico or ruby.ico   --> $(RUBY_INSTALL_NAME).exe
    $(RUBYW_INSTALL_NAME).ico or rubyw.ico --> $(RUBYW_INSTALL_NAME).exe
    the others                             --> $(RUBY_SO_NAME).dll

Although no icons are distributed with the ruby source or in the official 
site, you can use anything you like. For example, followings are written 
in Japanese, but you can download at least.

  ((<icon itself|URL:http://homepage1.nifty.com/a_nakata/ruby/RubyIcon.ico>))

== Build examples

* Build on the ruby source directory.

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\ruby
    build directory:        C:\ruby
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    C:
    cd \ruby
    win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

* Build on the relative directory from the ruby source directory.

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\ruby
    build directory:        C:\ruby\mswin32
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    C:
    cd \ruby
    mkdir mswin32
    cd mswin32
    ..\win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

* Build on the different drive.

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\src\ruby
    build directory:        D:\build\ruby
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    D:
    cd D:\build\ruby
    C:\src\ruby\win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install DESTDIR=C:

* Build x64 version (requires native x64 VC++ compiler)

  ex.)
    ruby source directory:  C:\ruby
    build directory:        C:\ruby
    install directory:      C:\usr\local

    C:
    cd \ruby
    win32\configure --prefix=/usr/local --target=x64-mswin64
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

== Bugs

You can ((*NOT*)) use a path name contains any white space characters as
the ruby source directory, this restriction comes from the behavior of
(({!INCLUDE})) directives of (({NMAKE})).
((- you may call it a bug. -))
