# * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derivative works",  *
# * yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid   *
# * misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law   *
# * allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a        *
# * derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the   *
# * following with any software or content covered by this license          *
# * ("Covered Software"):                                                   *
# *                                                                         *
# * o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         *
# *                                                                         *
# * o Reads or includes copyrighted data files, such as Nmap's nmap-os-db   *
# * or nmap-service-probes.                                                 *
# *                                                                         *
# * o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    *
# * results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will *
# * execute anything you tell them to).                                     *
# *                                                                         *
# * o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The *
# * installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including *
# * Nmap with other software in compressed or archival form does not        *
# * trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  *
# * or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    *
# * purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered *
# * Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  *
# * another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       *
# * Internet).                                                              *
# *                                                                         *
# * o Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the  *
# * above.                                                                  *
# *                                                                         *
# * o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.  *
# *                                                                         *
# * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *
# * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *
# * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *
# * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *
# * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *
# * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *
# * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *
# *                                                                         *
# * As another special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants  *
# * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *
# * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *
# * listed in the included docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute   *
# * linked combinations including the two.                                  *
# *                                                                         *
# * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *
# * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *
# * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *
# * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *
# * allowed.  All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as    *
# * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *
# *                                                                         *
# * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *
# * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *
# * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *
# * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *
# * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *
# * Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source        *
# * software.  Please contact fyodor@nmap.org with any such requests.       *
# * Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source software into  *
# * Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders. *
# *                                                                         *
# * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *
# * Nmap in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also    *
# * offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary            *
# * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *
# * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *
# * as providing for priority support and updates.  They also fund the      *
# * continued development of Nmap.  Please email sales@nmap.com for further *
# * information.                                                            *
# *                                                                         *
# * If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        *
# * Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  *
# * and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   *
# *                                                                         *
# * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *
# * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *
# * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes (none     *
# * have been found so far).                                                *
# *                                                                         *
# * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *
# * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *
# * to the dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the    *
# * main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the    *
# * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap  *
# * source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify otherwise) *
# * that you are offering the Nmap Project (Insecure.Com LLC) the           *
# * unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the      *
# * code.  Nmap will always be available Open Source, but this is important *
# * because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems *
# * for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also       *
# * occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed above.    *
# * If you wish to specify special license conditions of your               *
# * contributions, just say so when you send them.                          *
# *                                                                         *
