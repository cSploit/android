Introduction

   Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical Nmap frontend and results
   viewer.

   Zenmap is developed in the Python programming language, and its
   interface is built with the GTK Toolkit. It was originally derived
   from Umit, an Nmap GUI created as part of the Google Summer of Code.

   The project goal is to develop an Nmap frontend that is really useful
   for advanced users and easy to be used by newbies. With Zenmap, a
   network admin can create scan profiles for faster and easier network
   scanning and even compare scan results to easily see any changes. New
   users can also construct powerful scans with Zenmap profile editor.

Installation

   Zenmap is available for multiple platforms. It has been successfully
   tested on the following platforms/flavors:
     * Ubuntu 5.04 Hoary Hedgeog
     * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
     * OpenBSD 3.7
     * Microsoft Windows 2000
     * Microsoft Windows XP
     * Apple MacOS X 10.4 (Tiger)

   The installation instructions are somewhat different for each
   platform.

Default (source) Installation

   Zenmap is distributed as part of Nmap. Zenmap is installed along with
   Nmap if its dependencies are installed and Nmap was not configured
   with --without-zenmap.

   The list of required software follows:
     * [1]Python 2.4 or higher
     * [2]GTK+ 2.6 or higher
     * [3]PyGTK 2.6 or higher
     * [4]Nmap itself and its requirements
     * [5]PySQLite2

   Zenmap's source package are provided in such a way that, if you have
   all the required software, it will run 'out-of-the-tarball'. To run
   the program without installing it, after unpacking the source
   distribution do one of the following:
     * Double click the zenmap file
     * Call the Python interpreter on the zenmap file

   Zenmap is packaged using Python distutils. To install Zenmap
   independently of Nmap, enter the zenmap subdirectory and run
     python setup.py install
