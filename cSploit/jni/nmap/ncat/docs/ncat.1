.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Ncat is a feature\-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line\&. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project and is the culmination of the currently splintered family of Netcat incarnations\&. It is designed to be a reliable back\-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users\&. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential uses\&.
.PP
Among Ncat\*(Aqs vast number of features there is the ability to chain Ncats together; redirection of TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to other sites; SSL support; and proxy connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP proxies (with optional proxy authentication as well)\&. Some general principles apply to most applications and thus give you the capability of instantly adding networking support to software that would normally never support it\&.

.SH "CONNECT MODE AND LISTEN MODE"
.\" connect mode (Ncat)
.\" client mode (Ncat)
.\" listen mode (Ncat)
.\" server mode (Ncat)
.PP
Ncat operates in one of two primary modes: connect mode and listen mode\&. Other modes, such as the HTTP proxy server, act as special cases of these two\&. In connect mode, Ncat works as a client\&. In listen mode it is a server\&.
.PP
In connect mode, the
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
and
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
arguments tell what to connect to\&.
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
is required, and may be a hostname or IP address\&. If
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
is supplied, it must be a decimal port number\&. If omitted, it defaults to 31337\&..\" default port of Ncat.\" 31337
.PP
In listen mode,
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
and
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
control the address the server will bind to\&. Both arguments are optional in listen mode\&. If
\fB\fIhostname\fR\fR
is omitted, it defaults to listening on all available addresses over IPv4 and IPv6\&. If
\fB\fIport\fR\fR
is omitted, it defaults to 31337\&.

\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-unixsock\fR (Use Unix domain sockets) .\" --unixsock (Ncat option) .\" -U (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Use Unix domain sockets rather than network sockets\&. This option may be used on its own for stream sockets, or combined with
\fB\-\-udp\fR
for datagram sockets\&. A description of
\fB\-U\fR
mode is in
the section called \(lqUNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sctp\fR (Use SCTP) .\" --sctp (Ncat option)

.PP
\fB\-g \fR\fB\fIhop1\fR\fR\fB[,\fIhop2\fR,\&.\&.\&.]\fR (Loose source routing) .\" -g (Ncat option)

Sets hops for IPv4 loose source routing\&. You can use
\fB\-g\fR
once with a comma\-separated list of hops, use
\fB\-g\fR
multiple times with single hops to build the list, or combine the two\&. Hops can be given as IP addresses or hostnames\&.

.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-listen\fR (Listen for connections) .\" --listen (Ncat option) .\" -l (Ncat option)

.RE
.PP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\-open\fR (Accept multiple connections) .\" --keep-open (Ncat option) .\" -k (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Normally a listening server accepts only one connection and then quits when the connection is closed\&. This option makes it accept multiple simultaneous connections and wait for more connections after they have all been closed\&. It must be combined with
\fB\-\-listen\fR\&. In this mode there is no way for Ncat to know when its network input is finished, so it will keep running until interrupted\&. This also means that it will never close its output stream, so any program reading from Ncat and looking for end\-of\-file will also hang\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-broker\fR (Connection brokering) .\" --broker (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Allow multiple parties to connect to a centralised Ncat server and communicate with each other\&. Ncat can broker communication between systems that are behind a NAT or otherwise unable to directly connect\&. This option is used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-listen\fR, which causes the
\fB\-\-listen\fR
port to have broker mode enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-chat\fR (Ad\-hoc \(lqchat server\(rq) .\" --chat (Ncat option)
.RS 4
The
\fB\-\-chat\fR
option enables chat mode, intended for the exchange of text between several users\&. In chat mode, connection brokering is turned on\&. Ncat prefixes each message received with an ID before relaying it to the other connections\&. The ID is unique for each connected client\&. This helps distinguish who sent what\&. Additionally, non\-printing characters such as control characters are escaped to keep them from doing damage to a terminal\&.
.RE
.SH "SSL OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\fR (Use SSL) .\" --ssl (Ncat option)
.RS 4
In connect mode, this option transparently negotiates an SSL session with an SSL server to securely encrypt the connection\&. This is particularly handy for talking to SSL enabled HTTP servers, etc\&.
.sp
In server mode, this option listens for incoming SSL connections, rather than plain untunneled traffic\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-verify\fR (Verify server certificates) .\" --ssl-verify (Ncat option)
.RS 4
In client mode,
\fB\-\-ssl\-verify\fR
is like
\fB\-\-ssl\fR
except that it also requires verification of the server certificate\&. Ncat comes with a default set of trusted certificates in the file
ca\-bundle\&.crt.\" ca-bundle.crt\&. Some operating systems provide a default list of trusted certificates; these will also be used if available\&. Use
\fB\-\-ssl\-trustfile\fR
to give a custom list\&. Use
\fB\-v\fR
one or more times to get details about verification failures\&.
.\" revoked certificates
Ncat does not check for revoked certificates.\" certification revocation\&.
.sp
This option has no effect in server mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-cert \fR\fB\fIcertfile\&.pem\fR\fR (Specify SSL certificate) .\" --ssl-cert (Ncat option)
.RS 4
This option gives the location of a PEM\-encoded certificate files used to authenticate the server (in listen mode) or the client (in connect mode)\&. Use it in combination with
\fB\-\-ssl\-key\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-key \fR\fB\fIkeyfile\&.pem\fR\fR (Specify SSL private key) .\" --ssl-key (Ncat option)

This option gives the location of the PEM\-encoded private key file that goes with the certificate named with
\fB\-\-ssl\-cert\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ssl\-trustfile \fR\fB\fIcert\&.pem\fR\fR (List trusted certificates) .\" --ssl-trustfile (Ncat option)
.RS 4
This option sets a list of certificates that are trusted for purposes of certificate verification\&. It has no effect unless combined with
\fB\-\-ssl\-verify\fR\&. The argument to this option is the name of a PEM.\" PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail)
file containing trusted certificates\&. Typically, the file will contain certificates of certification authorities, though it may also contain server certificates directly\&. When this option is used, Ncat does not use its default certificates\&.
.RE
.SH "PROXY OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-proxy \fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR\fB[:\fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR\fB]\fR (Specify proxy address) .\" --proxy (Ncat option)
.RS 4
Requests proxying through
\fIhost\fR:\fIport\fR, using the protocol specified by
\fB\-\-proxy\-type\fR\&.
.sp
If no port is specified, the proxy protocol\*(Aqs well\-known port is used (1080 for SOCKS and 3128 for HTTP)\&. However, when specifying an IPv6 HTTP proxy server using the IP address rather than the hostname, the port number MUST be specified as well\&. If the proxy requires authentication, use
\fB\-\-proxy\-auth\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-proxy\-type \fR\fB\fIproto\fR\fR (Specify proxy protocol) .\" --proxy-type (Ncat option)
.RS 4
In connect mode, this option requests the protocol
\fIproto\fR
to connect through the proxy host specified by
\fB\-\-proxy\fR\&. In listen mode, this option has Ncat act as a proxy server using the specified protocol\&.
.sp
The currently available protocols in connect mode are
http
(CONNECT) and
socks4
(SOCKSv4)\&. The only server currently supported is
http\&. If this option is not used, the default protocol is
http\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Execute the specified command after a connection has been established\&. The command must be specified as a full pathname\&. All input from the remote client will be sent to the application and responses sent back to the remote client over the socket, thus making your command\-line application interactive over a socket\&. Combined with
\fB\-\-keep\-open\fR, Ncat will handle multiple simultaneous connections to your specified port/application like inetd\&. Ncat will only accept a maximum, definable, number of simultaneous connections controlled by the

.SH "EXIT CODE"
.PP
The exit code reflects whether a connection was made and completed successfully\&. 0 means there was no error\&. 1 means there was a network error of some kind, for example
\(lqConnection refused\(rq
or
\(lqConnection reset\(rq\&. 2 is reserved for all other errors, like an invalid option or a nonexistent file\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Like its authors, Ncat isn\*(Aqt perfect\&. But you can help make it better by sending bug reports or even writing patches\&. If Ncat doesn\*(Aqt behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest version available from
\m[blue]\fB\%http://nmap.org\fR\m[]\&. If the problem persists, do some research to determine whether it has already been discovered and addressed\&. Try Googling the error message or browsing the
nmap\-dev
archives at
\m[blue]\fB\%http://seclists.org/\fR\m[]\&.
.\" nmap-dev mailing list
Read this full manual page as well\&. If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
<dev@nmap\&.org>\&. Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of Ncat you are running and what operating system version it is running on\&. Problem reports and Ncat usage questions sent to dev@nmap\&.org are far more likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly\&.
.PP
Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports\&. Basic instructions for creating patch files with your changes are available at
\m[blue]\fB\%https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING\fR\m[]\&. Patches may be sent to
nmap\-dev
(recommended) or to Fyodor directly\&.

.SS "Source Code Availability and Community Contributions"
.PP
Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it\&. This also allows you to audit the software for security holes (none have been found so far)\&.
.PP
Source code also allows you to port Nmap (which includes Ncat) to new platforms, fix bugs, and add new features\&. You are highly encouraged to send your changes to
<dev@nmap\&.org>
for possible incorporation into the main distribution\&. By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the Insecure\&.Org development mailing lists, it is assumed that you are offering the Nmap Project (Insecure\&.Com LLC) the unlimited, non\-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code\&. Nmap will always be available open source,.\" open source
but this is important because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM)\&. We also occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed in the Nmap man page\&. If you wish to specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you send them\&.
