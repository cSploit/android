Ncat AUTHORS
============

Ncat is based in concept (but not code) on the original "Netcat"
written by Hobbit circa 1994. Ncat combines the original Netcat
feature set as well as various other ideas from other Netcat-like
products, such as CryptCat, Socat, GNU Netcat, etc.

Ncat was originally written from the ground up by Chris Gibson
(chris@linuxops.net) and was funded by the Google Summer of Code Program
2005.

Development, bug fixes, security auditing, improvements by Sean
(infamous42md@hotpop.com).

Starting with the Google Summer of Code 2008, Ncat development was
picked back up by Mixter and Kris Katterjohn.  This included many bug
fixes, new features and code cleanups.

The Ncat requirements, ideas and general support and help were given by
Fyodor.

Many helpful comments, suggestions and other useful information was
taken from the nmap-dev list (@insecure.org) as well as other
contributors via email.

Ncat shares the Nmap infrastructure libraries (Nsock and Nbase) which
were originally written by Fyodor.
