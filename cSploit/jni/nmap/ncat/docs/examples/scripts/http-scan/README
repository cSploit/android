HTTP-SCAN with Ncat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple exercise that uses a small amount of
scripted automation that will throw out the banner 
information of n number of hosts listed in the file "iplist".

Ncat uses the "get.request" HTTP header to get the newly
connected webserver to tell you about itself.

Usage: ./scan-example

Variables to change: None, but you may want to change "iplist" 
                     to other more informative hosts.
