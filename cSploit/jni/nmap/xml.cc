 * o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    *

 *                                                                         *

 * Nmap with other software in compressed or archival form does not        *
 * trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  *

 * This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  *
 * of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret *
 * the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   *
 * the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     *
 * these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      *
 * particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      *
 * source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    *
 *                                                                         *
 * As another special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants  *
 * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the     *
 * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that  *
 * listed in the included docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute   *
 * linked combinations including the two.                                  *
 *                                                                         *
 * Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    *
 * must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including *
 * obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    *
 * the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         *
 * allowed.  All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as    *
 * including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        *
 *                                                                         *
 * Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     *
 * Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL *
 * software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   *
 * be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open *
 * source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    *
 * Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source        *
 * software.  Please contact fyodor@nmap.org with any such requests.       *
 * Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source software into  *
 * Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders. *
 *                                                                         *
 * If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     *
 * Nmap in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above, we also    *
 * offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary            *
 * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens  *
 * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well  *
 * as providing for priority support and updates.  They also fund the      *
 * continued development of Nmap.  Please email sales@nmap.com for further *
 * information.                                                            *
 *                                                                         *
 * If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        *
 * Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  *
 * and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   *
 *                                                                         *
 * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     *
 * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. *
 * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes (none     *

 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,    *
 * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes   *
 * to the dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the    *
 * main distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the    *
 * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap  *

/*
This is a simple library for writing XML. It handles two main things:
keeping track of the element stack, and escaping text where necessary.
If you wanted to write this XML:
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <elem name="&amp;10.5"></elem>
these are the functions you would call. Each one is followed by the text
it prints enclosed in ||.

xml_start_document()                   |<?xml version="1.0"?>|
xml_newline();                         |\n|
xml_open_start_tag("elem");            |<elem|
xml_attribute("name", "&%.1f", 10.5);  | name="&amp;10.5"|
xml_close_start_tag();                 |>|
xml_end_tag();                         |</elem>|

The typical use is to call xml_open_start_tag, then call xml_attribute a
number of times. That is followed by xml_close_empty_tag, or else
xml_close_start_tag followed by xml_end_tag later on. You can call
xml_start_tag if there are no attributes. Whenever a start tag is opened
with xml_open_start_tag or xml_start_tag, the element name is pushed on
the tag stack. xml_end_tag pops the element stack and closes the element
it finds.

Here is a summary of all the elementary writing functions. The functions
return 0 on success and -1 on error. The terms "start" and "end" refer
to start and end tags and the start and end of comments. The terms
"open" and "close" refer only to start tags and processing instructions.

xml_start_comment()           |<!--|
xml_end_comment()             |-->|
xml_open_pi("elem")           |<?elem|
xml_close_pi()                |?>|
xml_open_start_tag("elem")    |<elem|
xml_close_start_tag()         |>|
xml_close_empty_tag()         |/>|
xml_start_tag("elem")         |<elem>|
xml_end_tag()                 |</elem>|
xml_attribute("name", "val")  | name="val"|
xml_newline()                 |\n|

Additional functions are

xml_write_raw                 Raw unescaped output.
xml_write_escaped             XML-escaped output.
xml_write_escaped_v           XML-escaped output, with a va_list.
xml_start_document            Writes <?xml version="1.0"?>.
xml_depth                     Returns the size of the element stack.

The library makes it harder but not impossible to make non-well-formed
XML. For example, you can call xml_start_tag, xml_end_tag,
xml_start_tag, xml_end_tag to create a document with two root elements.
Things like element names aren't checked to be sure they're legal. Text
given to these functions should be ASCII or UTF-8.

All writing is done with log_write(LOG_XML), so if LOG_XML hasn't been
opened, calling these functions has no effect.
