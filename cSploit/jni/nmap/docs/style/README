lua-format:
    This bash script uses lua-format.lua to indent and style Lua code
    (including NSE scripts and libraries). You can use this to make
    your script conform to the style guidelines for NSE.

    In order to run the script, you need Lua 5.1 or Lua 5.2 installed as well
    as LPeg. LPeg is a parsing expression grammar library which is basically a
    far more powerful pattern matching utility than regular expressions.
    On Debian:
        apt-get install lua5.2 lua-lpeg
