* Make Zenmap unit tests work. Guessing lots don't, since r32569 fixed real code
  that matched some unit tests, too.

* Make sure Ndiff, Zenmap are 2to3 compatible with python -3

* make build process detect Python major version (2 or 3). Breaks on Arch Linux,
  which uses Python 3 by default.

* Script to check for updated versions of included libs. Have shell for libpcap,
  but should convert to python.

* Get rid of global_structures.h (integrate into more-specific header files)

* NSE stuff
  * sstp-discover - review and commit
  * broadcast-srvloc-info - test
  * broadcast-rpcbind - write, test
  * Patrik's tns lib and oracle scripts
  * libssh or other SSH support
  * deflate/gzip for HTTP, etc.
  * Consolidate utility functions

* Grock libdnet, consider separate release?
