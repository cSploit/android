</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>define_key</STRONG> - define a keycode


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>define_key(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*definition,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>keycode);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to define keycodes  with  their  corresponding
       control  strings,  so that the ncurses library will inter-
       pret them just as it would the  predefined  codes  in  the
       terminfo database.

       If  the  given string is null, any existing definition for
       the keycode is removed.  Similarly, if the  given  keycode
       is  negative  or  zero,  any existing string for the given
       definition is removed.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The keycode must be greater than zero, and the string non-
       null, otherwise ERR is returned.  ERR may also be returned
       if there is insufficient memory to allocate  the  data  to
       store  the  definition.   If  no  error is detected, OK is
       returned.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These routines are specific to  ncurses.   They  were  not
       supported  on  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
       It is recommended that any code depending on them be  con-
       ditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
