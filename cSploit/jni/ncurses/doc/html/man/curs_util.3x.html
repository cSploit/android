<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>  routine returns a character string which is a
       printable representation of the character <EM>c</EM>, ignoring  at-
       tributes.   Control characters are displayed in the <STRONG>^</STRONG><EM>X</EM> no-
       tation.  Printing characters are  displayed  as  is.   The
       corresponding  <STRONG>wunctrl</STRONG>  returns a printable representation
       of a wide character.

       The <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> routine returns a character string correspond-
       ing to the key <EM>c</EM>:

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Printable  characters  are displayed as themselves,
              e.g., a one-character string containing the key.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Control characters are displayed in  the  <STRONG>^</STRONG><EM>X</EM>  nota-
              tion.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   DEL (character 127) is displayed as <STRONG>^?</STRONG>.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Values above 128 are either meta characters (if the
              screen has not been initialized,  or  if  <STRONG>meta</STRONG>  has
              been  called  with  a TRUE parameter), shown in the
              <STRONG>M-</STRONG><EM>X</EM> notation, or are displayed as  themselves.   In
              the  latter  case, the values may not be printable;
              this follows the X/Open specification.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Values above 256 may be the names of the  names  of
              function keys.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Otherwise  (if  there is no corresponding name) the
              function returns null, to denote an error.   X/Open
              also  lists  an  "UNKNOWN  KEY" return value, which
              some implementations return rather than null.

       The corresponding <STRONG>key_name</STRONG> returns a character string cor-
       responding  to  the wide-character value <EM>w</EM>.  The two func-
       tions do not return the same set of  strings;  the  latter
       returns null where the former would display a meta charac-
       ter.

       The <STRONG>filter</STRONG> routine, if used, must be called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>
       or  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>  are called.  The effect is that, during those
       calls, <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> is set to 1;  the  capabilities  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cup</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>cud</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cud1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>,  <STRONG>vpa</STRONG>  are  disabled; and the <STRONG>home</STRONG>
       string is set to the value of <STRONG>cr</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>nofilter</STRONG> routine cancels the  effect  of  a  preceding
       <STRONG>filter</STRONG>  call.   That  allows  the  caller  to initialize a
       screen on a different device, using a different  value  of
       <STRONG>$TERM</STRONG>.   The  limitation arises because the <STRONG>filter</STRONG> routine
       modifies the in-memory copy of the terminal information.

       The <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> routine, if used, is called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  or
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>  are  called.   When called with <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> as an argu-
       ment, the values of <STRONG>lines</STRONG> and  <STRONG>columns</STRONG>  specified  in  the
       <EM>terminfo</EM>  database will be used, even if environment vari-
       ables <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> and <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> (used by default) are set,  or  if
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  is  running in a window (in which case default be-
       havior would be to  use  the  window  size  if  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG>  are not set).  Note that setting <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> or <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG>
       overrides the corresponding size  which  may  be  obtained
       from the operating system.

       The  <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> routine writes all data associated with window
       <EM>win</EM> into the file to which <EM>filep</EM> points.  This information
       can be later retrieved using the <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> function.

       The <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> routine reads window related data stored in the
       file by <STRONG>putwin</STRONG>.  The routine then creates and  initializes
       a new window using that data.  It returns a pointer to the
       new window.

       The <STRONG>delay_output</STRONG> routine inserts an <EM>ms</EM>  millisecond  pause
       in  output.   This  routine should not be used extensively
       because padding characters are  used  rather  than  a  CPU
       pause.   If  no  padding character is specified, this uses
       <STRONG>napms</STRONG> to perform the delay.

       The <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG> routine throws away any  typeahead  that  has
       been  typed  by  the user and has not yet been read by the
       program.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except for <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG>, routines that return an  integer  re-
       turn  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4 specifies only "an in-
       teger value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this  im-
       plementation

          <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG>
               returns  an error if the terminal was not initial-
               ized.

          <STRONG>meta</STRONG> returns an error if the terminal was not  initial-
               ized.

          <STRONG>putwin</STRONG>
               returns  an  error  if the associated <STRONG>fwrite</STRONG> calls
               return an error.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue  4  describes  these  func-
       tions.   It  states  that <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> and <STRONG>wunctrl</STRONG> will return a
       null pointer if unsuccessful, but does not define any  er-
       ror conditions.  This implementation checks for three cas-
       es:

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the parameter is a 7-bit US-ASCII  code.   This  is
              the case that X/Open Curses documented.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the  parameter  is in the range 128-159, i.e., a C1
              control code.  If <STRONG>use_legacy_coding</STRONG> has been called
              with  a  <STRONG>2</STRONG> parameter, <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> returns the parameter,
              i.e., a one-character string with the parameter  as
              the first character.  Otherwise, it returns ``~@'',
              ``~A'', etc., analogous to ``^@'', ``^A'', C0  con-
              trols.

              X/Open  Curses does not document whether <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> can
              be called before initializing curses.  This  imple-
              mentation  permits  that,  and  returns the ``~@'',
              etc., values in that case.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   parameter values outside the 0 to 255 range.   <STRONG>unc-</STRONG>
              <STRONG>trl</STRONG> returns a null pointer.

       The SVr4 documentation describes the action of <STRONG>filter</STRONG> only
       in the vaguest terms.  The  description  here  is  adapted
       from  the  XSI Curses standard (which erroneously fails to
       describe the disabling of <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>).

       The strings returned by <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> in this implementation  are
       determined  at  compile time, showing C1 controls from the
       upper-128 codes with a `~' prefix rather than `^'.   Other
       implementations  have different conventions.  For example,
       they may show both sets of control  characters  with  `^',
       and  strip the parameter to 7 bits.  Or they may ignore C1
       controls and treat all of the upper-128  codes  as  print-
       able.  This implementation uses 8 bits but does not modify
       the string to reflect locale.  The <STRONG>use_legacy_coding</STRONG> func-
       tion allows the caller to change the output of <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>.

       Likewise,  the  <STRONG>meta</STRONG>  function allows the caller to change
       the output of <STRONG>keyname</STRONG>, i.e., it determines whether to  use
       the  `M-' prefix for ``meta'' keys (codes in the range 128
       to 255).  Both <STRONG>use_legacy_coding</STRONG> and <STRONG>meta</STRONG> succeed only af-
       ter  curses  is initialized.  X/Open Curses does not docu-
       ment the treatment of codes 128  to  159.   When  treating
       them as ``meta'' keys (or if <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> is called before ini-
       tializing curses),  this  implementation  returns  strings
       ``M-^@'', ``M-^A'', etc.

       The  <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> function may return the names of user-defined
       string capabilities which are defined in the terminfo  en-
       try  via  the <STRONG>-x</STRONG> option of <STRONG>tic</STRONG>.  This implementation auto-
       matically assigns at  run-time  keycodes  to  user-defined
       strings  which  begin  with  "k".   The  keycodes start at
       KEY_MAX, but are not guaranteed to be the same  value  for
       different  runs because user-defined codes are merged from
       all terminal descriptions which  have  been  loaded.   The
       <STRONG>use_extended_names</STRONG>  function controls whether this data is
       loaded when the terminal description is read  by  the  li-
       brary.

       The  <STRONG>nofilter</STRONG>  routine is specific to ncurses.  It was not
       supported on Version 7, BSD or System  V  implementations.
       It  is  recommended that any code depending on ncurses ex-
       tensions be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
