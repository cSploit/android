</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>bkgdset</STRONG> and <STRONG>wbkgdset</STRONG>  routines  manipulate  the  back-
       ground  of  the  named window.  The window background is a
       <STRONG>chtype</STRONG> consisting of any combination of attributes  (i.e.,
       rendition)  and  a  character.   The attribute part of the
       background is combined (OR'ed) with all non-blank  charac-
       ters  that  are written into the window with <STRONG>waddch</STRONG>.  Both
       the character and attribute parts of  the  background  are
       combined   with  the  blank  characters.   The  background
       becomes a property of the character  and  moves  with  the
       character   through   any   scrolling   and  insert/delete
       line/character operations.

       To the extent  possible  on  a  particular  terminal,  the
       attribute  part  of  the  background  is  displayed as the
       graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.

       The <STRONG>bkgd</STRONG> and <STRONG>wbkgd</STRONG> functions set the  background  property
       of  the  current  or  specified window and then apply this
       setting to every character position in that window:

              The rendition of every character on the  screen  is
              changed to the new background rendition.

              Wherever  the  former background character appears,
              it is changed to the new background character.

       The <STRONG>getbkgd</STRONG> function returns the  given  window's  current
       background character/attribute pair.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The  routines  <STRONG>bkgd</STRONG>  and <STRONG>wbkgd</STRONG> return the integer <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.  The
       SVr4.0 manual says "or a non-negative integer  if  <STRONG>immedok</STRONG>
       is set", but this appears to be an error.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <STRONG>bkgdset</STRONG> and <STRONG>bkgd</STRONG> may be macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These  functions are described in the XSI Curses standard,
       Issue 4.  It specifies that <STRONG>bkgd</STRONG> and <STRONG>wbkgd</STRONG> return  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  on
       failure, but gives no failure conditions.
