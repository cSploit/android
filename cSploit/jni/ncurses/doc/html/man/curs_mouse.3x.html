<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These  functions provide an interface to mouse events from
       <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>.  Mouse events are  represented  by  <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>
       pseudo-key values in the <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> input stream.

       To  make mouse events visible, use the <STRONG>mousemask</STRONG> function.
       This will set the mouse events to  be  reported.   By  de-
       fault,  no  mouse  events are reported.  The function will
       return a mask to indicate which  of  the  specified  mouse
       events  can be reported; on complete failure it returns 0.
       If oldmask is non-NULL, this function fills the  indicated
       location  with  the  previous  value of the given window's
       mouse event mask.

       As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask  may  turn  off
       the  mouse pointer; setting a nonzero mask may turn it on.
       Whether this happens is device-dependent.

       Here are the mouse event type masks which may be defined:


       <EM>Name</EM>                     <EM>Description</EM>

       BUTTON5_RELEASED         mouse button 5 up
       BUTTON5_CLICKED          mouse button 5 clicked
       BUTTON5_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse button 5 double clicked
       BUTTON5_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse button 5 triple clicked
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       BUTTON_SHIFT             shift was down during button state change
       BUTTON_CTRL              control was down during button state change
       BUTTON_ALT               alt was down during button state change
       ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS         report all button state changes
       REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION    report mouse movement
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       Once a class of mouse events have been made visible  in  a
       window, calling the <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> function on that window may re-
       turn <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG> as an indicator that a mouse event has been
       queued.   To read the event data and pop the event off the
       queue, call <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>.  This function will return <STRONG>OK</STRONG>  if  a
       mouse  event  is actually visible in the given window, <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>
       otherwise.  When <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG> returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG>, the  data  deposited
       as  y  and  x  in  the event structure coordinates will be
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates.  The  returned
       state  mask  will have exactly one bit set to indicate the
       event type.  The corresponding data in the queue is marked
       invalid.   A subsequent call to <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG> will retrieve the
       next older item from the queue.

       The <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG> function behaves  analogously  to  <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG>.
       It  pushes a <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG> event onto the input queue, and as-
       sociates with that event the given state data and  screen-
       relative character-cell coordinates.

       The  <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG>  function  tests  whether  a  given  pair of
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates is enclosed  by
       a  given  window, returning TRUE if it is and FALSE other-
       wise.  It is useful for determining  what  subset  of  the
       screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.

       The <STRONG>wmouse_trafo</STRONG> function transforms a given pair of coor-
       dinates from stdscr-relative  coordinates  to  coordinates
       relative to the given window or vice versa.  Please remem-
       ber, that stdscr-relative coordinates are not always iden-
       tical  to window-relative coordinates due to the mechanism
       to reserve lines on top or bottom of the screen for  other
       purposes (see the <STRONG>ripoffline()</STRONG> and <STRONG>slk_init</STRONG> calls, for ex-
       ample).  If the parameter <STRONG>to_screen</STRONG> is <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>, the  pointers
       <STRONG>pY,</STRONG> <STRONG>pX</STRONG> must reference the coordinates of a location inside
       the window <STRONG>win</STRONG>.  They are converted to window-relative co-
       ordinates  and returned through the pointers.  If the con-
       version was successful, the function returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>.  If one
       of  the  parameters was NULL or the location is not inside
       the window, <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> is returned.  If <STRONG>to_screen</STRONG> is <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>, the
       pointers  <STRONG>pY,</STRONG>  <STRONG>pX</STRONG>  must  reference window-relative coordi-
       nates.  They are converted to stdscr-relative  coordinates
       if  the  window <STRONG>win</STRONG> encloses this point.  In this case the
       function returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>.  If one of the parameters  is  NULL
       or  the point is not inside the window, <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> is returned.
       Please notice, that the referenced  coordinates  are  only
       replaced  by  the converted coordinates if the transforma-
       tion was successful.

       The <STRONG>mouse_trafo</STRONG> function performs the same translation  as
       <STRONG>wmouse_trafo</STRONG>, using stdscr for <STRONG>win</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>mouseinterval</STRONG> function sets the maximum time (in thou-
       sands of a second) that can elapse between press  and  re-
       lease  events  for  them to be recognized as a click.  Use
       <STRONG>mouseinterval(0)</STRONG> to disable click resolution.  This  func-
       tion returns the previous interval value.  Use <STRONG>mouseinter-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>val(-1)</STRONG> to obtain the interval without altering  it.   The
       default is one sixth of a second.

       The  <STRONG>has_mouse</STRONG>  function  returns TRUE if the mouse driver
       has been successfully initialized.

       Note that mouse events will be ignored when  input  is  in
       cooked mode, and will cause an error beep when cooked mode
       is being simulated in a window by a function such as  <STRONG>get-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>str</STRONG> that expects a linefeed for input-loop termination.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>  and <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG> return the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon fail-
       ure or <STRONG>OK</STRONG> upon successful completion.

              <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>
                   returns an error.  If no mouse driver was ini-
                   tialized, or if the mask parameter is zero, it
                   also returns an error if no more events remain
                   in the queue.

              <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG>
                   returns an error if the FIFO is full.

       <STRONG>mousemask</STRONG> returns the mask of reportable events.

       <STRONG>mouseinterval</STRONG>  returns the previous interval value, unless
       the terminal was not initialized.  In that  case,  it  re-
       turns the maximum interval value (166).

       <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG>  and <STRONG>wmouse_trafo</STRONG> are boolean functions returning
       <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> or <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> depending on their test result.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These calls were designed for  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>,  and  are  not
       found in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous
       version of curses.

       The feature macro <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</STRONG> is provided so the
       preprocessor  can  be  used to test whether these features
       are present.  If the interface is changed,  the  value  of
       <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</STRONG>  will  be incremented.  These values
       for <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</STRONG> may be specified when  configur-
       ing ncurses:

              1  has  definitions  for reserved events.  The mask
                 uses 28 bits.

              2  adds definitions for button 5, removes the defi-
                 nitions  for  reserved events.  The mask uses 29
                 bits.

       The order of the <STRONG>MEVENT</STRONG> structure members is  not  guaran-
       teed.   Additional fields may be added to the structure in
       the future.

       Under <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>, these calls are implemented  using  ei-
       ther  xterm's built-in mouse-tracking API or platform-spe-
       cific drivers including
              Alessandro Rubini's gpm server
              FreeBSD sysmouse
              OS/2 EMX
       If you  are  using  an  unsupported  configuration,  mouse
       events  will not be visible to <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG> (and the <STRONG>mouse-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>mask</STRONG> function will always return <STRONG>0</STRONG>).

       If the terminfo entry contains a <STRONG>XM</STRONG> string, this  is  used
       in  the xterm mouse driver to control the way the terminal
       is initialized for mouse operation.  The default, if <STRONG>XM</STRONG> is
       not found, corresponds to private mode 1000 of xterm:
              \E[?1000%?%p1%{1}%=%th%el%;
       The z member in the event structure is not presently used.
       It is intended for use with touch screens  (which  may  be
       pressure-sensitive)   or   with   3D-mice/trackballs/power
       gloves.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Mouse events under xterm will not in fact be ignored  dur-
       ing  cooked  mode, if they have been enabled by <STRONG>mousemask</STRONG>.
       Instead, the xterm mouse report sequence  will  appear  in
       the string read.

       Mouse events under xterm will not be detected correctly in
       a window with its keypad bit off, since  they  are  inter-
       preted  as  a  variety of function key.  Your terminfo de-
       scription should have <STRONG>kmous</STRONG> set to "\E[M"  (the  beginning
       of  the response from xterm for mouse clicks).  Other val-
       ues for <STRONG>kmous</STRONG> are permitted, but under  the  same  assump-
       tion, i.e., it is the beginning of the response.

       Because  there  are  no  standard  terminal responses that
       would serve to identify terminals which support the  xterm
       mouse  protocol,  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> assumes that if your $TERM envi-
       ronment variable contains "xterm", or <STRONG>kmous</STRONG> is defined  in
       the terminal description, then the terminal may send mouse
       events.
