</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>form_field_info</STRONG> - retrieve field characteristics


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;form.h&gt;</STRONG>
       int field_info(const FIELD *field, int *rows, int *cols,
                     int *frow, int *fcol, int *nrow, int *nbuf);
       int  dynamic_field_info(const FIELD *field, int *rows, int
       *cols, int *max);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  function  <STRONG>field_info</STRONG>  returns  the  sizes  and  other
       attributes  passed  in  to the field at its creation time.
       The attributes are: height, width, row of upper-left  cor-
       ner,  column of upper-left corner, number off-screen rows,
       and number of working buffers.

       The function <STRONG>dynamic_field_info</STRONG> returns the actual size of
       the  field,  and  its maximum possible size.  If the field
       has no size limit, the location  addressed  by  the  third
       argument will be set to 0.  A field can be made dynamic by
       turning off the <STRONG>O_STATIC</STRONG> option with <STRONG>field_opts_off</STRONG>.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       These routines return one of the following:

       <STRONG>E_OK</STRONG> The routine succeeded.

       <STRONG>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</STRONG>
            System error occurred (see <STRONG>errno</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</STRONG>
            Routine detected an incorrect or  out-of-range  argu-
            ment.


</PRE>
<H2>SEE ALSO</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3x)</A></STRONG> and related pages whose names begin "form_" for
       detailed descriptions of the entry points.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The header file <STRONG>&lt;form.h&gt;</STRONG> automatically includes the header
       file <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These  routines  emulate the System V forms library.  They
       were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

       A null (zero pointer) is accepted for any  of  the  return
       values,  to  ignore  that  value.  Not all implementations
       allow this, e.g., Solaris 2.7 does not.

       curses by Eric S. Raymond.
