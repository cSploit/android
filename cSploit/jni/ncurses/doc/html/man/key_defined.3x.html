<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>key_defined</STRONG> - check if a keycode is defined


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>key_defined(const</STRONG> <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*definition);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to determine if a string is currently bound to
       any keycode.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       If  the  string  is bound to a keycode, its value (greater
       than zero) is returned.  If no keycode is bound,  zero  is
       returned.   If  the  string  conflicts with longer strings
       which are bound to keys, -1 is returned.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These routines are specific to  ncurses.   They  were  not
       supported  on  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
       It is recommended that any code depending on them be  con-
       ditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
