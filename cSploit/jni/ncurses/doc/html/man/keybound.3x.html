<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>keybound</STRONG> - return definition of keycode


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>char</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG> <STRONG>keybound(int</STRONG> <STRONG>keycode,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>count);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to determine the string which  is  defined  in
       the terminfo for specific keycodes.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The <EM>keycode</EM> parameter must be greater than zero, else NULL
       is returned.  If it does not correspond to a defined  key,
       then  NULL  is  returned.   The <EM>count</EM> parameter is used to
       allow the application to iterate through multiple  defini-
       tions,  counting from zero.  When successful, the function
       returns a string which must be freed by the caller.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These routines are specific to  ncurses.   They  were  not
       supported  on  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
       It is recommended that any code depending on them be  con-
       ditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
