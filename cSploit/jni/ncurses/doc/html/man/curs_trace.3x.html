</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>trace</STRONG> routines are used for debugging the ncurses  li-
       braries, as well as applications which use the ncurses li-
       braries.  These functions are normally available only with
       the  debugging library <EM>libncurses</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>g.a</EM>, but may be compiled
       into any model (shared, static, profile) by  defining  the
       symbol  <STRONG>TRACE</STRONG>.   Additionally,  some  functions  are  only
       available with the wide-character configuration of the li-
       braries.

       The  principal  parts of this interface are the <STRONG>trace</STRONG> rou-
       tine which selectively enables different tracing features,
       and the <STRONG>_tracef</STRONG> routine which writes formatted data to the
       <EM>trace</EM> file.

       Calling <STRONG>trace</STRONG> with a  nonzero  parameter  opens  the  file
       <STRONG>trace</STRONG>  in the current directory for output.  The parameter
       is formed by OR'ing values from the list of <STRONG>TRACE_</STRONG><EM>xxx</EM> def-
       initions in <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>.  These include:

       TRACE_DISABLE
            turn off tracing.

       TRACE_TIMES
            trace user and system times of updates.

       TRACE_TPUTS
            trace tputs calls.

       TRACE_UPDATE
            trace update actions, old &amp; new screens.

       TRACE_MOVE
            trace cursor movement and scrolling.

       TRACE_CHARPUT
            trace all character outputs.

       TRACE_ORDINARY
            trace  all  update  actions.   The old and new screen
            contents are written to the trace file for  each  re-
            fresh.

       TRACE_CALLS
            trace all curses calls.  The parameters for each call
            are traced, as well as return values.

       TRACE_VIRTPUT
            trace virtual character puts, i.e., calls to <STRONG>addch</STRONG>.

       TRACE_IEVENT
            trace low-level input processing, including timeouts.

       TRACE_BITS
            trace state of TTY control bits.

       TRACE_ICALLS
            trace internal/nested calls.

       TRACE_CCALLS
            trace per-character calls.

       TRACE_DATABASE
            trace read/write of terminfo/termcap data.

       TRACE_ATTRS
            trace changes to video attributes and colors.

       TRACE_MAXIMUM
            maximum trace level,  enables  all  of  the  separate
            trace features.

       Some  tracing  features are enabled whenever the <STRONG>trace</STRONG> pa-
       rameter is nonzero.  Some features overlap.  The  specific
       names are used as a guideline.

       These  functions check the <STRONG>NCURSES_TRACE</STRONG> environment vari-
       able, to set the tracing feature as if <STRONG>trace</STRONG> was called:
              filter,  initscr,  new_prescr,  newterm,  nofilter,
              ripoffline, setupterm, slk_init, tgetent



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Routines  which  return a value are designed to be used as
       parameters to the <STRONG>_tracef</STRONG> routine.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These functions are not part of the XSI  interface.   Some
       other  curses  implementations  are known to have similar,
       undocumented features, but they are  not  compatible  with
       ncurses.
