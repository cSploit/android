</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These  routines  are included as a conversion aid for pro-
       grams that use the <EM>termcap</EM> library.  Their parameters  are
       the  same and the routines are emulated using the <EM>terminfo</EM>
       database.  Thus, they can only be used to query the  capa-
       bilities  of  entries  for which a terminfo entry has been
       compiled.

       The <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> routine loads the entry for <EM>name</EM>.  It  returns
       1  on  success, 0 if there is no such entry, and -1 if the
       terminfo database could not be found.  The  emulation  ig-
       nores the buffer pointer <EM>bp</EM>.

       The <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG> routine gets the boolean entry for <EM>id</EM>, or ze-
       ro if it is not available.

       The <STRONG>tgetnum</STRONG> routine gets the numeric entry for <EM>id</EM>,  or  -1
       if it is not available.

       The  <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG>  routine  returns the string entry for <EM>id</EM>, or
       zero if it is not available.  Use <STRONG>tputs</STRONG> to output the  re-
       turned  string.   The  return value will also be copied to
       the buffer pointed to by <EM>area</EM>, and the <EM>area</EM> value will  be
       updated to point past the null ending this value.

       Only the first two characters of the <STRONG>id</STRONG> parameter of <STRONG>tget-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>flag</STRONG>, <STRONG>tgetnum</STRONG> and <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG> are compared in lookups.

       The <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> routine instantiates  the  parameters  into  the
       given  capability.   The output from this routine is to be
       passed to <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>tputs</STRONG> routine is described  on  the  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">curs_terminfo(3x)</A></STRONG>
       manual page.  It can retrieve capabilities by either term-
       cap or terminfo name.

       The variables <STRONG>PC</STRONG>, <STRONG>UP</STRONG> and <STRONG>BC</STRONG> are set by <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> to the ter-
       minfo   entry's   data   for   <STRONG>pad_char</STRONG>,   <STRONG>cursor_up</STRONG>   and
       <STRONG>backspace_if_not_bs</STRONG>, respectively.   <STRONG>UP</STRONG>  is  not  used  by
       ncurses.  <STRONG>PC</STRONG> is used in the <STRONG>tdelay_output</STRONG> function.  <STRONG>BC</STRONG> is
       used in the <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> emulation.  The variable <STRONG>ospeed</STRONG>  is  set
       by ncurses in a system-specific coding to reflect the ter-
       minal speed.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except where explicitly noted, routines that return an in-
       teger  return <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4 only specifies
       "an integer value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful comple-
       tion.

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       If you call <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG> to fetch <STRONG>ca</STRONG> or any other parameterized
       string, be aware that it will be returned in terminfo  no-
       tation, not the older and not-quite-compatible termcap no-
       tation.  This will not cause problems if all you  do  with
       it  is  call  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  or <STRONG>tparm</STRONG>, which both expand terminfo-
       style strings as terminfo.  (The <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> function,  if  con-
       figured  to  support  termcap, will check if the string is
       indeed terminfo-style by looking for  "%p"  parameters  or
       "$&lt;..&gt;"  delays,  and invoke a termcap-style parser if the
       string does not appear to be terminfo).

       Because terminfo conventions for representing  padding  in
       string  capabilities  differ  from termcap's, <STRONG>tputs("50");</STRONG>
       will put out a literal "50" rather than  busy-waiting  for
       50 milliseconds.  Cope with it.

       Note  that termcap has nothing analogous to terminfo's <STRONG>sgr</STRONG>
       string.  One consequence of this is that termcap  applica-
       tions  assume me (terminfo <STRONG>sgr0</STRONG>) does not reset the alter-
       nate character set.  This implementation checks  for,  and
       modifies the data shown to the termcap interface to accom-
       modate termcap's limitation in this respect.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue  4  describes  these  func-
       tions.   However,  they are marked TO BE WITHDRAWN and may
       be removed in future versions.

       Neither the XSI Curses standard nor  the  SVr4  man  pages
       documented  the return values of <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> correctly, though
       all three were in fact returned ever since SVr1.  In  par-
       ticular,  an  omission in the XSI Curses documentation has
       been misinterpreted to mean that  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  returns  <STRONG>OK</STRONG>  or
       <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>.  Because the purpose of these functions is to provide
       compatibility with the <EM>termcap</EM> library, that is  a  defect
       in XCurses, Issue 4, Version 2 rather than in ncurses.

       External  variables  are  provided  for support of certain
       termcap applications.  However, termcap applications'  use
       of those variables is poorly documented, e.g., not distin-
       guishing between input and output.   In  particular,  some
       applications are reported to declare and/or modify <STRONG>ospeed</STRONG>.
