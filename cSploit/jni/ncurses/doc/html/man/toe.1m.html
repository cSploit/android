</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>toe</STRONG> - table of (terminfo) entries


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>toe</STRONG> [<STRONG>-v</STRONG>[<EM>n</EM>]] [<STRONG>-ahuUV</STRONG>] <EM>file...</EM>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       With no options, <STRONG>toe</STRONG> lists all available terminal types by
       primary name with descriptions.   File  arguments  specify
       the  directories  to  be scanned; if no such arguments are
       given, your default terminfo directory is scanned.  If you
       also  specify  the  <STRONG>-h</STRONG>  option, a directory header will be
       issued as each directory is entered.

       There are other options intended for use by terminfo  file
       maintainers:

       <STRONG>-a</STRONG>     report  on  all  of  the  terminal  databases which
              ncurses would search, rather than  only  the  first
              one that it finds.

       <STRONG>-u</STRONG> <EM>file</EM>
              says  to  write  a  report  to the standard output,
              listing dependencies in the given  terminfo/termcap
              source  file.  The report condenses the `use' rela-
              tion: each line consists of the primary name  of  a
              terminal  that  has use capabilities, followed by a
              colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary
              names  of  all  terminals  which occur in those use
              capabilities, followed by a newline

       <STRONG>-U</STRONG> <EM>file</EM>
              says to write a  report  to  the  standard  output,
              listing  reverse  dependencies  in  the  given ter-
              minfo/termcap source file.  The report reverses the
              `use'  relation:  each line consists of the primary
              name of a terminal that occurs in use capabilities,
              followed  by  a  colon, followed by the whitespace-
              separated primary  names  of  all  terminals  which
              depend on it, followed by a newline.

       <STRONG>-v</STRONG><EM>n</EM>    specifies that (verbose) output be written to stan-
              dard error, showing <STRONG>toe</STRONG>'s progress.   The  optional
              parameter  <EM>n</EM>  is a number from 1 to 10, interpreted
              as for <STRONG><A HREF="tic.1m.html">tic(1m)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>-V</STRONG>     reports the version of ncurses which  was  used  in
              this program, and exits.
