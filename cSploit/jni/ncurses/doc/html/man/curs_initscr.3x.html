</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> is normally the first <STRONG>curses</STRONG> routine to call  when
       initializing  a program.  A few special routines sometimes
       need to be called before it; these are  <STRONG>slk_init</STRONG>,  <STRONG>filter</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>,  <STRONG>use_env</STRONG>.  For multiple-terminal applications,
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> may be called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.

       The initscr code determines the terminal type and initial-
       izes  all <STRONG>curses</STRONG> data structures.  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> also causes the
       first call to <STRONG>refresh</STRONG> to clear the screen.  If errors  oc-
       cur,  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> writes an appropriate error message to stan-
       dard error and exits; otherwise, a pointer is returned  to
       <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.

       A  program  that  outputs to more than one terminal should
       use the <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>  routine  for  each  terminal  instead  of
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.  A program that needs to inspect capabilities, so
       it can continue to run in a line-oriented mode if the ter-
       minal cannot support a screen-oriented program, would also
       use <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.  The routine <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> should  be  called  once
       for each terminal.  It returns a variable of type <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG>
       which should be saved as a  reference  to  that  terminal.
       The  arguments  are the <EM>type</EM> of the terminal to be used in
       place of <STRONG>$TERM</STRONG>, a file pointer for output to the terminal,
       and  another  file pointer for input from the terminal (if
       <EM>type</EM> is <STRONG>NULL</STRONG>, <STRONG>$TERM</STRONG> will be used).  The program must  also
       call  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  for  each terminal being used before exiting
       from <STRONG>curses</STRONG>.  If <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> is called more than once for  the
       same  terminal, the first terminal referred to must be the
       last one for which <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> is called.

       A program should always call <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> before exiting or  es-
       caping  from  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  mode  temporarily.  This routine re-
       stores tty modes, moves the cursor to the lower  left-hand
       corner  of  the  screen  and  resets the terminal into the
       proper non-visual mode.  Calling <STRONG>refresh</STRONG> or <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG> after
       a  temporary  escape  causes  the program to resume visual
       mode.

       The <STRONG>isendwin</STRONG> routine  returns  <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>  if  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  has  been
       called without any subsequent calls to <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>, and <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>
       otherwise.

       The <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> routine is used to switch  between  different
       terminals.   The screen reference <STRONG>new</STRONG> becomes the new cur-
       rent terminal.  The previous terminal is returned  by  the
       routine.   This  is  the  only  routine  which manipulates
       <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG> pointers; all other routines affect only  the  cur-
       rent terminal.

       The  <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>  routine  frees storage associated with the
       <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG> data structure.  The <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  routine  does  not  do
       this, so <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG> should be called after <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> if a par-
       ticular <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG> is no longer needed.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> returns the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure  and  <STRONG>OK</STRONG>  upon
       successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers always return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.

       X/Open  defines  no error conditions.  In this implementa-
       tion <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> returns an error if the terminal was not  ini-
       tialized.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> and <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> may be macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These  functions are described in the XSI Curses standard,
       Issue 4.  It specifies that portable applications must not
       call <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> more than once.

       Old versions of curses, e.g., BSD 4.4, may have returned a
       null pointer from  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  when  an  error  is  detected,
       rather  than  exiting.   It is safe but redundant to check
       the return value of <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> in XSI Curses.
