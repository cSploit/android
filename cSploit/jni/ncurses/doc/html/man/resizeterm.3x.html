       <STRONG>is_term_resized</STRONG>,  <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG>,  <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG>  -  change  the
       curses terminal size


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>bool</STRONG> <STRONG>is_term_resized(int</STRONG> <STRONG>lines,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>columns);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>resize_term(int</STRONG> <STRONG>lines,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>columns);</STRONG>
       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>resizeterm(int</STRONG> <STRONG>lines,</STRONG> <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>columns);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This is an extension to the curses library.   It  provides
       callers  with  a hook into the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> data to resize win-
       dows, primarily for use by programs running in an X Window
       terminal  (e.g.,  xterm).  The function <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> resizes
       the standard and current windows to the  specified  dimen-
       sions,  and  adjusts  other  bookkeeping  data used by the
       <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library that record the window dimensions.

       Most  of  the  work  is  done  by   the   inner   function
       <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG>.  The outer function <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> adds bookkeep-
       ing for the SIGWINCH handler.  When resizing the  windows,
       <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG>  blank-fills the areas that are extended.  The
       calling application should fill in these areas with appro-
       priate  data.  The <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG> function attempts to resize
       all windows.  However, due to the  calling  convention  of
       pads,  it  is  not  possible to resize these without addi-
       tional interaction with the application.

       A support function <STRONG>is_term_resized</STRONG>  is  provided  so  that
       applications  can  check if the <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG> function would
       modify the window structures.  It returns TRUE if the win-
       dows would be modified, and FALSE otherwise.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except  as  notes,  these  function return the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>
       upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on success.  They will fail if  either
       of the dimensions are less than or equal to zero, or if an
       error occurs while (re)allocating memory for the windows.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       While these functions are intended to be used to support a
       signal  handler (i.e., for SIGWINCH), care should be taken
       to avoid invoking them in a context where <STRONG>malloc</STRONG> or  <STRONG>real-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>loc</STRONG>  may  have been interrupted, since it uses those func-
       tions.

       If ncurses is configured to supply its own  SIGWINCH  han-
       dler, the <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> function ungetch's a <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG> which
       will be read on the next call to <STRONG>getch</STRONG>.  This is  used  to
       alert an application that the screen size has changed, and
       that it should repaint special features such as pads  that
       cannot be done automatically.

       If  the  environment  variables  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> or <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> are set,
       this overrides  the  library's  use  of  the  window  size
       obtained  from the operating system.  Thus, even if a SIG-
       WINCH is received, no screen size change may be  recorded.
       In that case, no <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG> is queued for the next call to
       <STRONG>getch</STRONG>; an <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> will be returned instead.
