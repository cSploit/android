</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>getch</STRONG>, <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvgetch</STRONG> and <STRONG>mvwgetch</STRONG>, routines  read  a
       character  from the window.  In no-delay mode, if no input
       is waiting, the value <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> is returned.  In delay mode, the
       program  waits until the system passes text through to the
       program.  Depending on the setting of <STRONG>cbreak</STRONG>, this is  af-
       ter  one  character (cbreak mode), or after the first new-
       line (nocbreak mode).  In  half-delay  mode,  the  program
       waits  until a character is typed or the specified timeout
       has been reached.

       Unless <STRONG>noecho</STRONG> has been set, then the character  will  also
       be echoed into the designated window according to the fol-
       lowing rules: if the character is the current erase  char-
       acter,  left  arrow, or backspace, the cursor is moved one
       space to the left and that screen position is erased as if
       <STRONG>delch</STRONG> had been called.  If the character value is any oth-
       er <STRONG>KEY_</STRONG> define, the user is  alerted  with  a  <STRONG>beep</STRONG>  call.
       Otherwise the character is simply output to the screen.

       If the window is not a pad, and it has been moved or modi-
       fied since the last call to  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>,  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>  will  be
       called before another character is read.

       If  <STRONG>keypad</STRONG> is <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>, and a function key is pressed, the to-
       ken for that function key is returned instead of  the  raw
       characters.   Possible function keys are defined in <STRONG>&lt;curs-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>es.h&gt;</STRONG> as macros with values outside  the  range  of  8-bit
       characters  whose  names begin with <STRONG>KEY_</STRONG>. Thus, a variable
       intended to hold the return value of a function  key  must
       be of short size or larger.

       When a character that could be the beginning of a function
       key is received (which, on modern terminals, means an  es-
       cape character), <STRONG>curses</STRONG> sets a timer.  If the remainder of
       the sequence does not come in within the designated  time,
       the  character  is passed through; otherwise, the function
       key value is returned.  For this  reason,  many  terminals
       experience a delay between the time a user presses the es-
       cape key and the escape is returned to the program.

       The <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG> routine places <EM>ch</EM> back onto the input queue to
       be returned by the next call to <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>.  There is just one
       input queue for all windows.


   <STRONG>Function</STRONG> <STRONG>Keys</STRONG>
       The following function keys, defined in <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>,  might
       be  returned  by  <STRONG>getch</STRONG>  if <STRONG>keypad</STRONG> has been enabled.  Note
       that not all of these are  necessarily  supported  on  any
       particular terminal.

                         +-----+------+-------+
                         |<STRONG>left</STRONG> |  <STRONG>B2</STRONG>  | <STRONG>right</STRONG> |
                         +-----+------+-------+
                         | <STRONG>C1</STRONG>  | <STRONG>down</STRONG> |  <STRONG>C3</STRONG>   |
                         +-----+------+-------+
       The <STRONG>has_key</STRONG> routine takes a key value from the above list,
       and returns TRUE or FALSE according to whether the current
       terminal type recognizes a key with that value.  Note that
       a  few  values  do  not  correspond  to  a real key, e.g.,
       <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG> and <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>.  See <STRONG><A HREF="resizeterm.3x.html">resizeterm(3x)</A></STRONG> for more de-
       tails  about  <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG>, and <STRONG><A HREF="curs_mouse.3x.html">curs_mouse(3x)</A></STRONG> for a discus-
       sion of <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>.



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All routines return the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon  failure  and  an
       integer value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> (<STRONG>OK</STRONG> in the case of ungetch())
       upon successful completion.

              <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG>
                   returns an error if there is no more  room  in
                   the FIFO.

              <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>
                   returns  an  error  if  the  window pointer is
                   null, or if its timeout expires without having
                   any data.

       Functions  with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor move-
       ment using <STRONG>wmove</STRONG>, and return an error if the  position  is
       outside the window, or if the window pointer is null.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Use of the escape key by a programmer for a single charac-
       ter function is discouraged, as it will cause a  delay  of
       up to one second while the keypad code looks for a follow-
       ing function-key sequence.

       Note that some keys may be the same as commonly used  con-
       trol keys, e.g., <STRONG>KEY_ENTER</STRONG> versus control/M, <STRONG>KEY_BACKSPACE</STRONG>
       versus control/H.  Some curses implementations may  differ
       according  to  whether  they treat these control keys spe-
       cially (and ignore the terminfo), or use the terminfo def-
       initions.   <STRONG>Ncurses</STRONG>  uses  the terminfo definition.  If it
       says  that  <STRONG>KEY_ENTER</STRONG>  is  control/M,  <STRONG>getch</STRONG>  will  return
       <STRONG>KEY_ENTER</STRONG> when you press control/M.

       Generally,  <STRONG>KEY_ENTER</STRONG> denotes the character(s) sent by the
       <EM>Enter</EM> key on the numeric keypad:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the terminal description lists the most useful keys,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the <EM>Enter</EM> key on the regular keyboard is already  han-
           dled by the standard ASCII characters for carriage-re-
           turn and line-feed,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   depending on whether <STRONG>nl</STRONG> or <STRONG>nonl</STRONG> was  called,  pressing
           "Enter"  on  the  regular keyboard may return either a
           carriage-return or line-feed, and finally

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   "Enter or send" is the standard description  for  this
           key.

       When  using  <STRONG>getch</STRONG>, <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvgetch</STRONG>, or <STRONG>mvwgetch</STRONG>, nocbreak
       mode (<STRONG>nocbreak</STRONG>) and echo mode (<STRONG>echo</STRONG>) should not be used at
       the  same  time.  Depending on the state of the tty driver
       when each character is typed, the program may produce  un-
       desirable results.

       Note that <STRONG>getch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvgetch</STRONG>, and <STRONG>mvwgetch</STRONG> may be macros.

       Historically, the set of keypad macros was largely defined
       by the extremely function-key-rich keyboard  of  the  AT&amp;T
       7300,  aka  3B1,  aka Safari 4.  Modern personal computers
       usually have only a small subset of these.   IBM  PC-style
       consoles   typically  support  little  more  than  <STRONG>KEY_UP</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>KEY_DOWN</STRONG>,   <STRONG>KEY_LEFT</STRONG>,   <STRONG>KEY_RIGHT</STRONG>,   <STRONG>KEY_HOME</STRONG>,    <STRONG>KEY_END</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>KEY_NPAGE</STRONG>, <STRONG>KEY_PPAGE</STRONG>, and function keys 1 through 12.  The
       Ins key is usually mapped to <STRONG>KEY_IC</STRONG>.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The *get* functions are described in the XSI Curses  stan-
       dard,  Issue  4.   They  read single-byte characters only.
       The standard specifies that they return  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  on  failure,
       but specifies no error conditions.

       The  echo  behavior of these functions on input of <STRONG>KEY_</STRONG> or
       backspace characters was not specified in the  SVr4  docu-
       mentation.  This description is adopted from the XSI Curs-
       es standard.

       The behavior of <STRONG>getch</STRONG> and friends in the presence of  han-
       dled  signals  is  unspecified  in the SVr4 and XSI Curses
       documentation.  Under historical  curses  implementations,
       it  varied depending on whether the operating system's im-
       plementation  of  handled  signal  receipt  interrupts   a
       <STRONG><A HREF="read.2.html">read(2)</A></STRONG>  call in progress or not, and also (in some imple-
       mentations) depending on whether an input timeout or  non-
       blocking mode has been set.

       Programmers concerned about portability should be prepared
       for either of two cases: (a) signal receipt does  not  in-
       terrupt  <STRONG>getch</STRONG>;  (b)  signal  receipt interrupts <STRONG>getch</STRONG> and
       causes it to return ERR with <STRONG>errno</STRONG> set  to  <STRONG>EINTR</STRONG>.   Under
       the  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  implementation, handled signals never inter-
       rupt <STRONG>getch</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>has_key</STRONG> function is unique to <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>.   We  recommend
       that  any  code  using it be conditionalized on the <STRONG>NCURS-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>ES_VERSION</STRONG> feature macro.
