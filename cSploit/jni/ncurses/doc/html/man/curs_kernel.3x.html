</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  following  routines  give low-level access to various
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG> capabilities.  These routines  typically  are  used
       inside library routines.

       The  <STRONG>def_prog_mode</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>def_shell_mode</STRONG>  routines save the
       current terminal modes as the  "program"  (in  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>)  or
       "shell"   (not  in  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>)  state  for  use  by  the  <STRONG>re-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>set_prog_mode</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset_shell_mode</STRONG> routines.  This is done
       automatically by <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.  There is one such save area for
       each screen context allocated by <STRONG>newterm()</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>reset_prog_mode</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset_shell_mode</STRONG> routines  restore
       the  terminal  to "program" (in <STRONG>curses</STRONG>) or "shell" (out of
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG>) state.  These are  done  automatically  by  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>
       and,  after  an  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>, by <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>, so they normally are
       not called.

       The <STRONG>resetty</STRONG> and <STRONG>savetty</STRONG>  routines  save  and  restore  the
       state  of  the  terminal modes.  <STRONG>savetty</STRONG> saves the current
       state in a buffer and <STRONG>resetty</STRONG> restores the state  to  what
       it was at the last call to <STRONG>savetty</STRONG>.

       The  <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> routine returns the current coordinates of the
       virtual screen cursor in <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM>.  If <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG> is currently
       <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>,  then <STRONG>-1</STRONG>,<STRONG>-1</STRONG> is returned.  If lines have been removed
       from the top of the screen, using <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>, <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM>  in-
       clude  these lines; therefore, <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM> should be used only
       as arguments for <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> routine sets the virtual screen cursor to <EM>y</EM>, <EM>x</EM>.
       If <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM> are both <STRONG>-1</STRONG>, then <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG> is set.  The two rou-
       tines <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> and <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> are designed to be used by  a  li-
       brary  routine,  which manipulates <STRONG>curses</STRONG> windows but does
       not want to change the current position of  the  program's
       cursor.   The library routine would call <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> at the be-
       ginning, do its manipulation of  its  own  windows,  do  a
       <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG>  on  its  windows, call <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG>, and then call
       <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG> routine provides access to the same facili-
       ty  that  <STRONG>slk_init</STRONG>  [see  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_slk.3x.html">curs_slk(3x)</A></STRONG>] uses to reduce the
       size of the screen.   <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>  must  be  called  before
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> is called.  If <EM>line</EM> is positive, a line
       is removed from the top of <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>; if <EM>line</EM> is negative,  a
       line is removed from the bottom.  When this is done inside
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>, the routine <STRONG>init</STRONG> (supplied by the user) is called
       with  two arguments: a window pointer to the one-line win-
       dow that has been allocated and an integer with the number
       of columns in the window.  Inside this initialization rou-
       tine, the integer variables <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>COLS</STRONG>  (defined  in
       <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>) are not guaranteed to be accurate and <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>
       or <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG> must not be called.  It is allowable  to  call
       <STRONG>wnoutrefresh</STRONG> during the initialization routine.

       <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>  can  be called up to five times before calling
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG> routine sets the cursor state  to  invisible,
       normal, or very visible for <STRONG>visibility</STRONG> equal to <STRONG>0</STRONG>, <STRONG>1</STRONG>, or <STRONG>2</STRONG>
       respectively.  If the terminal supports the <EM>visibility</EM> re-
       quested, the previous <EM>cursor</EM> state is returned; otherwise,
       <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> is returned.

       The <STRONG>napms</STRONG> routine is used to sleep for <EM>ms</EM> milliseconds.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except for <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG>, these routines always return <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG> returns the previous cursor state, or <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if  the
       requested <EM>visibility</EM> is not supported.

       X/Open  defines  no error conditions.  In this implementa-
       tion

              <STRONG>def_prog_mode</STRONG>, <STRONG>def_shell_mode</STRONG>, <STRONG>reset_prog_mode</STRONG>, <STRONG>re-</STRONG>
              <STRONG>set_shell_mode</STRONG>
                   return  an  error if the terminal was not ini-
                   tialized, or if the I/O  call  to  obtain  the
                   terminal settings fails.

              <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>
                   returns  an  error  if  the  maximum number of
                   ripped-off lines exceeds the maximum (NRIPS  =
                   5).


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note  that <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> is a macro, so <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> is not necessary before
       the variables <EM>y</EM> and <EM>x</EM>.

       Older SVr4  man  pages  warn  that  the  return  value  of
       <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG>  "is  currently  incorrect".  This implementation
       gets it right, but it may be unwise to count on  the  cor-
       rectness of the return value anywhere else.

       Both  ncurses  and  SVr4  will  call <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG> in <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> if
       <STRONG>curs_set</STRONG> has been called to make  the  cursor  other  than
       normal,  i.e., either invisible or very visible.  There is
       no way for ncurses to determine the initial  cursor  state
       to restore that.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  functions  <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> and <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> are not described in the
       XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  All other functions are  as
       described in XSI Curses.

       The SVr4 documentation describes <STRONG>setsyx</STRONG> and <STRONG>getsyx</STRONG> as hav-
       ing return type int.  This  is  misleading,  as  they  are
       macros with no documented semantics for the return value.
