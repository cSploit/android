</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>keyok</STRONG> - enable or disable a keycode


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>

       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>keyok(int</STRONG> <STRONG>keycode,</STRONG> <STRONG>bool</STRONG> <STRONG>enable);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to disable specific keycodes, rather than  use
       the  <EM>keypad</EM>  function  to disable all keycodes.  Keys that
       have been disabled can be re-enabled.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The keycode  must  be  greater  than  zero,  else  ERR  is
       returned.   If  it  does  not correspond to a defined key,
       then ERR is returned.  If the <EM>enable</EM>  parameter  is  true,
       then  the  key  must  have  been disabled, and vice versa.
       Otherwise, the function returns OK.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These routines are specific to  ncurses.   They  were  not
       supported  on  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
       It is recommended that any code depending on them be  con-
       ditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
