.SH DESCRIPTION
This page summarizes variables provided by the \fBcurses\fP library's
low-level terminfo interface.
A more complete description is given in the \fBcurs_terminfo\fP(3X) manual page.
.PP
Depending on the configuration, these may be actual variables,
or macros (see \fBcurs_threads\fR(3X))
which provide read-only access to \fIcurses\fP's state.
In either case, applications should treat them as read-only to avoid
confusing the library.
.SS Alternate Character Set Mapping
After initializing the curses or terminfo interfaces,
the \fBacs_map\fP array holds information used to translate cells
with the \fBA_ALTCHARSET\fP video attribute into line-drawing characters.
.PP
The encoding of the information in this array has changed periodically.
Application developers need only know that it is used for the "ACS_"
constants in <curses.h>.
.PP
The comparable data for the wide-character library is a private variable.
.SS Current Terminal Data
After initializing the curses or terminfo interfaces,
the \fBcur_term\fP contains data describing the current terminal.
This variable is also set as a side-effect of \fBset_term\fP(3X)
and \fBdelscreen\fP(3X).
.PP
It is possible to save a value of \fBcur_term\fP for subsequent
use as a parameter to \fBset_term\fP, for switching between screens.
Alternatively, one can save the return value from \fBnewterm\fP
or \fBsetupterm\fP to reuse in \fBset_term\fP.
.SS Terminfo Names
The \fBtic\fP(1) and \fBinfocmp\fP(1) programs use lookup tables for
the long and short names of terminfo capabilities,
as well as the corresponding names for termcap capabilities.
These are available to other applications,
though the hash-tables are not available.
.PP
The long terminfo capability names use a "l" (ell) in their names:
boolfnames
numfnames
strfnames
.PP
These are the short names for terminfo capabilities:
boolnames,
numnames, and
strnames.
.PP
These are the corresponding names used for termcap descriptions:
boolcodes,
numcodes, and
strcodes.
.SS Terminal Type
On initialization of the curses or terminfo interfaces,
\fBsetupterm\fP copies the terminal name to the array \fBttytype\fP.
.SH NOTES
The low-level terminfo interface is initialized using \fBsetupterm\fR(3X).
The upper-level curses interface uses the low-level terminfo interface,
internally.
.SH PORTABILITY
X/Open Curses does not describe any of these except for \fBcur_term\fP.
(The inclusion of \fBcur_term\fP appears to be an oversight,
since other comparable low-level information is omitted by X/Open).
.PP
Other implementations may have comparable variables.
Some implementations provide the variables in their libraries,
but omit them from the header files.
