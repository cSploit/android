New in 1.14:
* The 'iconv' program now produces its output as soon as it can. It no longer
  unnecessarily waits for more input.
* Updated the GB18030 converter to map 25 characters to code points that have
  been to Unicode since 2000, rather than to code points in the Private Use
  Area.
* Updated the BIG5-HKSCS converter. The old BIG5-HKSCS converter is renamed to
  BIG5-HKSCS:2004. A new converter BIG5-HKSCS:2008 is added. BIG5-HKSCS is now
  an alias for BIG5-HKSCS:2008.
* Fixed a bug in the conversion to wchar_t.
* Fixed a small bug in the CP1258 converter.

New in 1.13:
* The library and the iconv program now understand platform dependent aliases,
  for better compatibility with the platform's own iconv_open function.
  Examples: "646" on Solaris, "iso88591" on HP-UX, "IBM-1252" on AIX.
* For stateful encodings, when the input ends with a shift sequence followed
  by invalid input, the iconv function now increments the input pointer past
  the shift sequence before returning (size_t)(-1) with errno = EILSEQ. This
  is also like GNU libc's iconv() behaves.
* The library exports a new function iconv_open_into() that stores the
  conversion descriptor in pre-allocated memory, rather than allocating fresh
  memory for it.
* Added CP1131 converter.

New in 1.12:
* The iconv program is now licensed under the GPL version 3, instead of the
  GPL version 2. The libiconv library continues to be licensed under LGPL.
* Added RK1048 converter.
* On AIX, an existing system libiconv no longer causes setlocale() to fail.
* Upgraded EUC-KR, JOHAB to include the Korean postal code sign.

New in 1.11:
* The iconv program has new options --unicode-subst, --byte-subst,
  --widechar-subst that allow to specify substitutions for characters that
  cannot be converted.
* The iconv program now understands long options:
    long option    equivalent to
    --from-code    -f
    --to-code      -t
    --list         -l
    --silent       -s
* The CP936 converter is now different from the GBK converter: it has changed
  to include the Euro sign and private area characters. CP936 is no longer an
  alias of GBK.
* Updated GB18030 converter to include all private area characters.
* Updated CP950 converter to include the Euro sign and private area characters.
* Updated CP949 converter to include private area characters.
* Updated the BIG5-HKSCS converter. The old BIG5-HKSCS converter is renamed to
  BIG5-HKSCS:1999 and updated to Unicode 4. New converters BIG5-HKSCS:2001 and
  BIG5-HKSCS:2004 are added. BIG5-HKSCS is now an alias for BIG5-HKSCS:2004.
* Added a few irreversible mappings to the CP932 converter.
* Tidy up the list of symbols exported from libiconv (assumes gcc >= 4.0).

New in 1.10:

* Updated the ISO-8859-7 converter.
* Added ATARIST converter, available through --enable-extra-encodings.

  --enable-extra-encodings.

  preloadable_libiconv.so.

  Unicode 3.2.
* Upgraded EUC-KR, CP949, JOHAB converters to include the Euro sign.
* Changed the ARMSCII-8 converter.
* Extended the EUC-JP encoder so that YEN SIGN characters don't cause failures
  in Shift_JIS to EUC-JP conversion.
* The JAVA converter now handles characters outside the Unicode BMP correctly.
* Fixed a bug in the CP1255, CP1258, TCVN decoders: The base characters of
  combining characters could be dropped at the end of the conversion buffer.
* Fixed a bug in the transliteration that could lead to excessive memory
  allocations in libintl when transliteration was needed.
* Portability to BSD/OS and SCO 3.2.5.

  fullwidth tilde instead of halfwidth tilde.
