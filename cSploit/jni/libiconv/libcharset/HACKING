All you need to know when hacking (modifying) GNU libcharset or when building
it off the CVS.


Requirements
============

You will need reasonably recent versions of the build tools:

  * A C compiler. Such as GNU GCC.
    + Homepage:
      http://gcc.gnu.org/

  * GNU autoconf
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  * GNU m4
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

  * Perl
    + Homepage:
      http://www.perl.org/

And, of course, the packages listed in the DEPENDENCIES file.


Building off the CVS
====================

Access to the CVS is described at http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=51585 .

After fetching the sources from the CVS, peek at the comments in autogen.sh,
then run "./autogen.sh"; then you can proceed with "./configure" as usual.
