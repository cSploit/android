Maybe you want to look at LIMITATIONS in README. Some might consider
them to be bugs.

But there are really problems that might be fixed in the future.

If you find some problem unlisted in this file, contact me at
"Petr Vandrovec" <vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might experience lockups of ncpfs volumes. It happens especially
under high network traffic, not necessarily only IPX traffic. I am not
able to reproduce this problem on my machine, so I'm sorry I can not
do anything about that. When such a lockup happens, you have to shut
down the complete ipx subsystem by deleting all ipx interfaces,
unmounting all ncpfs volumes (in this order!) and restarting all
again.

This problem has been solved by Martin Stover (THANKS!!)
See patches/lockup-2.0.30.diff for the fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'df' returns 0: Free disk space is distributed among the volumes in
NetWare. df is only able to report one number per mounted
filesystem. As connections are quite expensive for NetWare (with
mars_nwe and lwared that might change ...), I rejected the alternative
to mount only a single volume for a unix mount point. So I simply
return 0.

If you use Linux 1.2.x, In your kernel log there will appear messages
like

Nov 25 16:09:08 lx01 kernel: alloc_skb called nonatomically from interrupt 0000002e

These are a bit annoying, but completely harmless.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known bugs:

- If GetNearsetServer returns invalid (nonexistant, downed) server, all
  utilities gives up. VLM/Client32 in this situation tries randomly choosen
  server after 30 secs timeout. You have to fix your routers at this time. 
  Sorry.
- nwdplist does nothing good. This tool will be finished after nwnet.c...
- manpages names for 3ncp section are too long... Is there a way to 
  define page header or ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known incompatibilities:

PROBLEM:   ncpfs is not compatible with NSS volumes of beta releases of NW5
SOLUTION:  Upgrade your NW5 to production NW5 version.

PROBLEM:   ncpfs cannot access LinWare server
SOLUTION:  LinWare does not support namespace calls used by ncpfs. Because of
           LinWare is currently not maintained, you should fix it yourself or
	   move your server to MarsNWE or Caldera's NetWare for Linux.
