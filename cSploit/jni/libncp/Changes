ChangeSet@1.306, 2005-01-27 18:25:25+01:00
  Fix CAN-2005-0013 and CAN-2005-0014.  
  
  Fix CAN-2005-0013: Run with euid == uid for most of time, and switch 
  to euid == 0 only when really needed.
  
  And although previous change decreases impact of CAN-2005-0014, let's 
  fix random small static character arrays too.
  
  And when modprobe is spawned (on 2.0.x kernel), start it with empty
  environment.

ChangeSet@1.305, 2005-01-27 18:16:38+01:00
  Move nds_login_auth prototype where it belongs.

ChangeSet@1.304, 2005-01-13 23:35:33+01:00
  Kill strcpy_cw function, it has no right to survive.

ChangeSet@1.303, 2005-01-13 21:54:08+01:00
  Obviously when I added nds_login_auth() to nwnet.h header, I should 
  have removed it from "obsolete" headers...

ChangeSet@1.302, 2005-01-13 20:57:58+01:00
  Well, I hoped that nds_login_auth will die before it will become part 
  of API, but as I did not get to write NWDSLogin()-like function for
  about 5 years, it is probably time to finally accept this patch.
  
  Add nds_login_auth to ncpfs headers.

  Oops, this should have been checked before NWDSCreateContextHandleMnt 
  changes.

ChangeSet@1.294, 2004-11-30 16:42:25+01:00
  Fix bad buffer overflow in NWDSCreateContextHandleMnt.  Plus fix
  bogus interpretation of treeName.  And split 
  NWDSCreateContextHandleMnt into two functions, anything taking string
  as argument must take context, as string's encoding is defined by 
  context settings...

ChangeSet@1.293, 2004-11-30 16:40:03+01:00
  NCP extensions support.  First version.

  Add support for generating slackware src packages.

ChangeSet@1.268, 2003-06-14 22:37:35+02:00
  Wait until ncpd exits when closing NCP connection. Otherwise ncpd can still run while
  we are trying to open new connection (which fails due to local address still in use).

ChangeSet@1.260, 2003-04-06 04:09:49+02:00
  Use closing of pipe instead of sending signal for signalling watchdog process.
  Caller can do set*euid() between ncp_open() and ncp_close(), and it can happen
  that caller at ncp_close() time has no rights to send signals to process created
  at ncp_open() time :-(
  
  Use doublefork for watchdog process so caller does not see this child...

ChangeSet@1.253, 2003-03-13 15:37:42+01:00
  When user presents name with context to login prompt, it is not good idea
  to append context once more to the username...
  
  Also add leading dot to the FQDN so that ncpmount works even if /etc/ncpfs.conf
  is not empty.

ChangeSet@1.252, 2003-03-13 15:10:12+01:00
  Add -L option to pam_ncp_auth to ignore services restrictions based on access point.

ChangeSet@1.238, 2003-02-14 09:26:02+01:00
  Update /etc/ncpfs.conf format to allow unquoted values with embeded 
  spaces. We'll need that in future for 'NDS BIND' without quotes...

ChangeSet@1.237, 2003-02-13 10:20:37+01:00
  Store session key also for temporary connections, so NDS aware utilities
  as for example pqstat or nprint can do what they promise. 
  
  Please note bindery authentication is tried first, and if you are 
  bindery authenticated then there is no session key, and thus no background
  authentication. So you may want to use FQDN instead of short name for
  pqstat or nprint.

  NCP search for file set always returns filename, even if we did not asked for one.
  Let's always ask for name, so there is no surprise with some other/future server 
  implementations.

ChangeSet@1.191, 2002-09-15 00:27:15+02:00
  Fix big-endian problems by using nw_info_struct2 instead of nw_info_struct. 
  
  API always returned nw_info_struct in "NCP" (little-endian) byte order, but when structure 
  was passed to API, it expected volume and directory entry numbers to be in native byte order.
  
  In addition to the problem above, nobody except nwdir get byte order completely right - some
  forgot to byteswap volume number, and some both.

ChangeSet@1.183, 2002-08-30 21:44:23+02:00
  Add code which prints connections not closed on library shutdown. Build ncpfs with
  --enable-ncp-debug, and then set environment variable NCP_DEBUG to cleanup.

ChangeSet@1.182, 2002-08-30 21:29:22+02:00
  There is no install-dev in Makefile generated in contrib/php.

ChangeSet@1.181, 2002-08-30 21:19:35+02:00
  Regenerate .gmo files.

ChangeSet@1.179, 2002-08-30 21:17:52+02:00

ChangeSet@1.176, 2002-08-23 00:12:28+02:00
  Update ncpmount/ncplogin/ncpmap for mount version 5. Main change is that
  we now handle Netware messages in IP environment - of course only if you
  have appropriate kernel...

ChangeSet@1.175, 2002-08-23 00:01:59+02:00

  Kill now unused variable in nwsfind.

ChangeSet@1.171, 2002-08-21 21:48:15+02:00
  Kill libncpsu. Only difference between libncp and libncpsu was ipx_make_reachable. Now
  library contains both suid and non-suid versions, and appropriate one is selected at
  runtime.
  Modify nwsfind to always call suid version, even if nwsfind is not installed suid.

ChangeSet@1.170, 2002-08-21 19:52:15+02:00
  Split reply buffer from request buffer. Since we verify signatures on replies we must be
  able to retry requests after we receive reply (with wrong signature), and so we cannot
  receive reply into request's buffer.
  Create NCP request header in the do_ncp_call, and not in its callers, so callers do not have
  to touch sequence numbers, connection numbers, and so on.

ChangeSet@1.169, 2002-08-21 19:42:29+02:00
  Change x_recv/x_recvfrom to return err and pass length through additional parameter,
  instead of returning length and passing err indirectly.

ChangeSet@1.168, 2002-08-20 23:39:58+02:00
  NCP/UDP signs replies differently than NCP/IPX, it does not sign error code
  and connection status. Oops.

ChangeSet@1.167, 2002-08-20 21:40:17+02:00
  Verify packet signatures on replies received from server.

ChangeSet@1.166, 2002-08-20 19:21:09+02:00
  Kill few warnings here and there:
  Add missing prototypes.
  Remove < 0 compares on unsigned values.
  Explicitly cast int to size_t in comparsions.

ChangeSet@1.165, 2002-08-20 18:50:13+02:00
  Packet signatures for NCP/TCP. Length in the signed data is in big-endian format,
  while NCP/UDP and NCP/IPX use little-endian and I oversight this difference...

ChangeSet@1.164, 2002-08-19 01:42:44+02:00
  Fix ncp signatures negotiation code. NCP/TCP signatures still do not work.

ChangeSet@1.163, 2002-08-19 01:40:06+02:00
  Use NCP_OBSOLETE for obsolete APIs.

ChangeSet@1.162, 2002-08-06 20:15:37+02:00
  Exit from pserver when broken connection is detected. 
  Helps a lot if you are running pserver with -d from inittab as a respawn task.

ChangeSet@1.161, 2002-08-06 18:48:44+02:00

  Update czech translation.
  Regenerate i18n files.

ChangeSet@1.156, 2002-07-06 18:26:32+02:00
  Mark "yes" and "no" strings in nwfsinfo eligible for i18n.

ChangeSet@1.155, 2002-07-06 18:25:05+02:00
  stuil/ncpm_common.c contains i18n strings too.

ChangeSet@1.150, 2002-07-05 00:25:44+02:00
  Add physical records locking API.
  Add test program for physical records locks.
  Tests for locking above 4GB fails on my beta NW6SP2 test server. I believe it is server bug, because of same API suceeds with offsets < 4GB...

ChangeSet@1.149, 2002-07-03 23:37:44+02:00
  Welcome, 64bit NCPs... Tested with nw6nss1c. Test it only in test environment, 
  read+get file length works fine, but write abends server when UDP or TCP transport is used.
  Only IPX works correctly...
