This VERSION of the snapin is for uses on pré-DS8 
shcemas
It *may* uses the following Unix properties 
that must be created with Schemax
with the following names and syntaxes
and associated to USER and GROUP classes.

If you don't like extending the schema, don't create
theses attributes and stuff everything in L ( Location
attribute) visible on the Identification page of NWADmin.

For USERS:

"LINUX:UID"     		SYN_INTEGER
"LINUX:Primary GroupName"	SYN_DIST_NAME
"LINUX:Primary GroupID"   	SYN_INTEGER
"LINUX:GID"		  	SYN_INTEGER	
"LINUX:Login Shell"		SYN_CE_STRING
"LINUX:Home Directory"		SYN_CE_STRING
"LINUX:Comments"		SYN_CI_STRING

for GROUPS:
"LINUX:GID"			SYN_INTEGER



// Either way , the snapin will always try to get *missing* data
// from the L attribute
// Of course NDS8 real or dummy attributes have priority, that is
// if both exists "NDS8" attribute will keep their values and the
// L attribute value will be erased when saving back the NDS.
So you can migrate slowly...

 User:
	 U:nnn       Unix UID
	 G:nnn       Unix GID
	 S:/.../...  Unix Shell
	 H:/.../.... Unix Home
  Group:
	  G:nnn      Unix GID

 Currently the following attributes recognized by the PAM module
 are NOT modifiable by this snapin. You should modify them
 using the "built-in" string editor of NWADmin under the Identification Page
  ( Location attribute):
  User:
	  O: Unix or NDS name of other group ( if that group is a NDS name
			and has a N:nnnn attribute, this value will be used for
			 translation to Unix name, otherwise, a "proper Unix name"
			 will be made from the NDS one ( remove context part,
			 skip all spaces and illegal chars and prepend a Z if its
			 starts by a digit (  this is required by useradd/usermod
			 that misbehave with a group name starting with a digit)
		C: Unix comment, added to the Gecos field after the full name
		(-comma separator added)
		P: Primary group name. So far the snapin works with the numeric
			  Primary Group ID for user's. It may change in the next release.

 Of course any other L (location) strings is left untouched by the snapin
  ( no error message)!
