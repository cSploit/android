This snapin uses the real Unix properties of DS8 and above
with the following names and syntaxes

"UNIX:UID"
"UNIX:Primary GroupName"
"UNIX:Primary GroupID"
"UNIX:GID"
"UNIX:Login Shell"
"UNIX:Comments"
"UNIX:Home Directory"

You can use it on  non DS8 schémas in that case, you must stuff
Unix properties in the L attribute ( Location string under thhe
Identification page of NWAdmin32).

 Either way , the snapin will always try to get *missing* data
 from the L attribute
 Of course NDS8 (real or dummy) attributes have priority, that is
 if both exists NDS8 attribut will keep their values and the
 L attribute value will be erased when saving the NDS.

 User:
	 U:nnn       Unix UID
	 G:nnn       Unix GID
	 S:/.../...  Unix Shell
	 H:/.../.... Unix Home
  Group:
	  G:nnn      Unix GID

 Currently the following attributes recognized by the PAM module
 are NOT modifiable by this snapin. You should modify them
 using the "built-in" string editor of NWADmin under the Identification Page
  ( Location attribute):
  User:
	  O: Unix or NDS name of other group ( if that group is a NDS name
			and has a N:nnnn attribute, this value will be used for
			 translation to Unix name, otherwise, a "proper Unix name"
			 will be made from the NDS one ( remove context part,
			 skip all spaces and illegal chars and prepend a Z if its
			 starts by a digit (  this is required by useradd/usermod
			 that misbehave with a group name starting with a digit)
		C: Unix comment, added to the Gecos field after the full name
		(-comma separator added)
		P: Primary group name. So far the snapin works with the numeric
			  Primary Group ID for user's. It may change in the next release.

 Of course any other L (location) strings is left untouched by the snapin
  ( no error message)!
