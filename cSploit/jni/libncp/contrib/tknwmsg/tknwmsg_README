-- INTRO --

Tknwmesg is a extension for ncpfs for linux that allows users to recived messages
while under an X console.  

Essentially it is an extension for nwmsg that comes with ncpfs.  The only 
changes are a system() call to a tk script that will run a dialog with an "ok"
button under X.

--  INSTALLATION --
TCL/TK must be installed on your system.  If they are not then you will have to
get the source for their installation if you want to run tkmesg.  

	-  Download ncpfs from sunsite.unc.edu
	-  Run "su" to become root if you are not already root.
	-  Unpack ncpfs in a temporary directory.
	-  copy the Tknwmsg nwmsg.c to util/nwmsg.c in your ncpfs directory.
	-  copy tknwmsg to /usr/bin
	-  change to your nwmsg directory.
	-  run "make all;make install" and the new version of tknwmsg will be 
	   installed.
	  
--  USE --

	- At least 1 terminal on the local system must be have "mesg y".  Else
	  no GUI dialog will be displayed.
          
          Using mesg y in a .bashrc will not work.  The only way that I have 
	  found to do this is to have chmod a+w /dev/ttyp? in Xsession or 
   	  $HOME/.xsession.  Also it may be necessary to have .bashrc do the
	  same thing if users are starting and stopping xterms.
