This is beta code. You need special swig-1.3.10
version, available on request from vandrove@vc.cvut.cz,
as I have to do couple of changes in swig to get it
to work as I expected.

If you are installing this code, on Debian system
just run 'make'. On other systems run 'perl Makefile.PL',
then 'touch ncpfs.int ncpfs.pm ncpfs_wrap.c' (as you
have no swig to regenerate them), and then 'make',
'make install', and so on...

I put generated files also to 'generated' subdirectory,
as 'make clean' removes them...

And DO NOT RUN test.pl UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU DO!
It requires server VMWARE-NW6 mounted somewhere, and
then it creates/deletes files, directories, bindery
objects, NDS objects, NDS partitions and containers and
so on on that server to verify that all API functions
work correctly. It is VERY dangerous example...
