There is certainly not enough material to call this an FAQ, but some
questions reach me regularly. Probably the documentation is not clear
enough.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: The ncpfs utilities like slist or ncpmount tell me that they can
   not find a server, although I'm sure there are servers on my
   net. What's wrong?

You probably used 

ipx_configure --auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on 

and you have Windows (95?) workstations on your network. Windows 95
makes Linux configure IPX interfaces for non-existent frame types. To
solve this problem, you have to configure your IPX interface manually
with the command

ipx_interface add -p <device> <frame>

For <device> use eth0, eth1 or whatever you network adapter is
called. The value for <frame> must match the frame type used on your
network. Possible values are 802.2, 802.3, SNAP and EtherII.

Q: I have difficulties with NetWare 4.1. What can I do?

To be honest, I do not really know. Currently my only test equipment
is a NetWare 3.11 server. You should make your 4.1 Server as
3.x-compatible as it can be. As I do not know 4.1, you are on your own
doing this.

A promising hint that has already helped some people is to switch off
packet signatures on the 4.1 server, as ncpfs does not support them.

Note: ncpfs, as of 2.0.12, and kernel 2.1.89, does now support packet 
signatures.
Note2: My test environment currently consist of couple of NW4.11/NW5 servers.
I have no 3.x servers around anymore.

Q: When I re-export ncpfs-mounted directories via nfs, I get messages like
   'pwd: cannot get current directory', and other strange things happen to
   the nfs clients. What's wrong?

When you want to export a directory via NFS, you have to do two things:

- You have to invoke mountd and nfsd with the option --re-export. On my
  computer, both are invoked at system startup from the file
  /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2.

- You can not export a complete NetWare server hierarchy with all volumes
  under a single mount point. You have to mount a single server volume to
  make it re-exportable. Invoke ncpmount with the option -V volume to do
  this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I cannot login into server with these utilities. It was possible with an
older version.

A: You are probably connecting into Netware 4.x or IntraNetware. If you want a
temporary workaround, add the option "-b" to the ncpmount commandline.
For the future you should determine your Directory Services user name and
use that instead of your bindery name.

Q: I found bug. What I should do?

A: Report it to "Petr Vandrovec" <vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>.
