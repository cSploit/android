.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nwfstime
displays a NetWare server's date and time. You can also set a NetWare
server's date and time from the local time.

.SH OPTIONS

.B -h
.RS 3
With -h nwfstime prints a little help text.
.RE

.B -S
.I server
.RS 3
is the name of the server you want to use.
.RE

.B -U
.I user
.RS 3
.B user
is the user name to use for login. To set the server's time, you need
supervisor privileges.
.RE

.B -P
.I password
.RS 3
.B password
is the password to use for login. If neither
.B -n
nor
.B -P
are given, and the user has no open connection to the server, nwfstime
prompts for a password.
.RE

.B -n
.RS 3
.B -n
should be given if no password is required for the login. As you need
supervisor privileges for setting the date and time, this option is
probably not used very often.
.RE

.B -C
.RS 3
By default, passwords are converted to uppercase before they are sent
to the server, because most servers require this. You can turn off
this conversion by
.B -C.
.RE

.B -s
.RS 3
With
.B -s,
nwfstime sets the file server's date and time according to the local
date and time.
