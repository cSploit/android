# This is a very cut down version of wrap.tcl.  We don't want to
# use wrap.tcl because that will create yet another Tcl subprocess
# to execute the test.  We want to open the test program directly
# here so that we get the pid for the program (not the Tcl shell)
# and watch_procs can kill the program if needed.
