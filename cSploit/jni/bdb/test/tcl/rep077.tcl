# TEST	Replication, recovery and applying log records immediately.
# TEST	Master and 1 client.  Start up both sites.
# TEST	Close client and run rep_test on the master so that the
# TEST	log record is the same LSN the client would be expecting.
# TEST	Reopen client with recovery and verify the client does not
# TEST	try to apply that "expected" record before it synchronizes
