# TEST	rep034
# TEST	Test of STARTUPDONE notification.
# TEST
# TEST	STARTUPDONE can now be recognized without the need for new "live" log
# TEST  records from the master (under favorable conditions).  The response to
# TEST  the ALL_REQ at the end of synchronization includes an end-of-log marker
# TEST  that now triggers it.  However, the message containing that end marker
# TEST  could get lost, so live log records still serve as a back-up mechanism.
# TEST  The end marker may also be set under c2c sync, but only if the serving
# TEST  client has itself achieved STARTUPDONE.
