/**
 * A Part represents the combined key/data pair for a part entity.
 *
 * <p> In this sample, Part is bound to the stored key/data entry by
 * implementing the MarshalledEnt interface, which is called by {@link
 * SampleViews.MarshalledEntityBinding}. </p>
 *
 * <p> The binding is "tricky" in that it uses this class for both the stored
 * data entry and the combined entity object.  To do this, the key field(s) are
 * transient and are set by the binding after the data object has been
 * deserialized. This avoids the use of a PartData class completely. </p>
 *
 * <p> Since this class is used directly for data storage, it must be
 * Serializable. </p>
