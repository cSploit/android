 * A Shipment represents the combined key/data pair for a shipment entity.

 * using TupleSerialEntityBinding.  See {@link SampleViews.PartBinding} for
 * details.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> The binding is "tricky" in that it uses this class for both the stored
 * data entry and the combined entity object.  To do this, the key field(s)
 * are transient and are set by the binding after the data object has been
 * deserialized. This avoids the use of a ShipmentData class completely. </p>
 *
 * <p> Since this class is used directly for data storage, it must be
 * Serializable. </p>
