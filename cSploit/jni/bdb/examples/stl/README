StlAccessExample.cpp		Simple Database Access.

	Exstl_access uses STL simple features based on the DB access methods.

	Build: make exstl_access


repquote/			Replication.  

	Exstl_repquote creates a toy stock quote server
	with DB's single-master, multiple-client replication
	with communication over TCP, via STL API.  See repquote/README.

	Build: make exstl_repquote


StlTransactionGuideExample.cpp	Multithreaded DB Access.

	StlTxnGuide runs multiple threads to access databases via STL API.

	Build: make StlTxnGuide


StlTpcbExample.cpp		TPC/B.

	Exstl_tpcb sets up a framework in which to run a TPC/B test 
	via the STL API.

	Database initialization (the -i flag) and running the
	benchmark (-n flag) must take place separately (i.e.,
	first create the database, then run 1 or more copies of
	the benchmark).  Furthermore, when running more than one
	TPCB process, it is necessary to run the deadlock detector
	(db_deadlock), since it is possible for concurrent tpcb
	processes to deadlock.  For performance measurement, it
	will also be beneficial to run the db_checkpoint process
	as well.

	Build: make exstl_tpcb
