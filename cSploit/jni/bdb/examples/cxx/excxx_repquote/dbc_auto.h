/*
 * Resource-acquisition-as-initialization pattern for Berkeley DB's cursors.
 *
 * Use DbcAuto instead of Berkeley DB's builtin Dbc class.  The constructor
 * allocates a new cursor, and it is freed automatically when it goes out of
 * scope.
 *
 * Note that some care is required with the order in which Berkeley DB handles
 * are closed.  In particular, the cursor handle must be closed before any
 * database or transaction handles the cursor references.  In addition, the
 * cursor close method can throw exceptions, which are masked by the destructor.
 * 
 * For these reasons, you are strongly advised to call the DbcAuto::close
 * method in the non-exceptional case.  This class exists to ensure that
 * cursors are closed if an exception occurs.
