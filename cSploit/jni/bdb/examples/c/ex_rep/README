# $Id$

This is the parent directory for the replication example programs.

The example is a toy stock quote server.  There are two versions of
the program: one version uses Berkeley DB's Replication Manager
support, and the other uses the base replication API.

common/		Contains code to implement the basic functions of the
                application, to demonstrate that these are largely
                independent of which replication API is used.

mgr/            Contains the small amount of code necessary to
                configure the application to use Replication Manager.

base/           Contains the sample communications infrastructure, and
                other replication support code, to demonstrate some of
                the kinds of things that are necessary when using the
                base replication API.
