	 * we convert to a (potentially) smaller fixed-size type and use it.
	 *
	 * We don't worry about byte sexing or the actual variable sizes.
	 *
	 * When this routine is called from the DB access methods, it's only
	 * called once -- whatever ID is generated when a database is created
	 * is stored in the database file's metadata, and that is what is
	 * saved in the mpool region's information to uniquely identify the
	 * file.
	 *
	 * When called from the mpool layer this routine will be called each
	 * time a new thread of control wants to share the file, which makes
	 * things tougher.  As far as byte sexing goes, since the mpool region
	 * lives on a single host, there's no issue of that -- the entire
	 * region is byte sex dependent.  As far as variable sizes go, we make
	 * the simplifying assumption that 32-bit and 64-bit processes will
	 * get the same 32-bit values if we truncate any returned 64-bit value
	 * to a 32-bit value.  When we're called from the mpool layer, though,
	 * we need to be careful not to include anything that isn't
	 * reproducible for a given file, such as the timestamp or serial
	 * number.
