/*
 * QNX has special requirements on FSYNC: if the file is a shared memory
 * object, we can not call fsync because it is not implemented, instead,
 * we set the O_DSYNC flag to the file descriptor  and then do an empty
 * write so that all data are synced. We only sync this way if the file
 * is a shared memory object, other types of ordinary files are still synced
 * using fsync, to be not only faster but also atomic.
 * We don't just set the O_DSYNC flag on open, since it would force all writes
 * to be sync'ed. And we remove the O_DSYNC if it is not originally set to
 * the file descriptor before passed in to this function.
 * This is slightly different to the VxWorks and hp code above, since QNX does
 * supply a fsync call, it just has a unique requirement.
