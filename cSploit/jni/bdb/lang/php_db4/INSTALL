Build and installation instructions for Berkeley DB PHP support
on Linux or *nix machines.  Note that while it is still called "db4" these
instructions apply to Berkeley DB 5.x as well.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. This module and instructions require that Berkeley DB be configured and 
built using --enable-cxx to enable C++. It is assumed that this has been
done.

2. PHP must be installed on the machine along with the PHP development
environment which includes header files and tools such as "phpize."

Basic build
-----------

To install this php module execute the following steps:

$ phpize
$ ./configure --with-db4=<path-to-BDB-installation-directory>
  (e.g. ./configure --with-db4=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.5.1)
$ make
$ su -
$ make install

If you are using the Apache PHP module, see instructions below.
If you are using the CLI (command line interface) to PHP, add this to
the php.ini file you use:

extension=db4.so

See examples in the "samples" directory.  The samples create their data in
/var/tmp by default and the transaction_counter.php example requires 
that /var/tmp/dbhome exist. The samples can be edited to change these 
requirements.

Apache 2 Configuration
----------------------

Most users will use PHP in a web server module, typically Apache.  These
are the steps you'll need to use to allow Berkeley DB PHP scripts to run
inside the PHP module for Apache 2.  Because installation among
machines varies your specific commands will likely be different.  This 
is an example of how it can work.

1. Install and get running Apache 2 with a working PHP module.

This can be done by building PHP from source or by using prebuilt modules 
available for most *nix machines (easier).  These instructions tell you 
how to do this from source:
      http://php.net/manual/en/install.php

Here's how you might use installation packages (e.g. on Ubuntu).  This 
approach is simpler than building from scratch.  The packages
may already be installed on your system.  Other Linux distributions use
different package tools (e.g. rpm, yum, etc) for installation.  
Permission to do these operations is assumed:

$ apt-get install apache2  (the web server)
$ apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5  (the PHP module)
$ apt-get install php5-dev  (this is needed for the Berkeley DB build)

At this point you need to verify that (1) your web server is working and
(2) you can run PHP (*.php) scripts.  Do that before attempting to use
Berkeley DB.  This can be done by copying a simple php script to your
web site and running it.

2. Build Berkeley DB support for PHP (see instructions above).  Be
sure to "make install" as well.  The php.ini file portion can be ignored 
for this configuration.

3. Determine the locations of:
   a.  the php.ini file for the PHP module.  For example it may be in
   /etc/php5/apache2 if you installed binaries on Ubuntu.
   b.  the root of your web site.  This may be /var/www or wherever it
   was configured for your server.

4. Add this line to the php.ini file:
extension=db4.so

5. Restart the web server (e.g. apache2ctl restart)

6. Try out a simple Berkeley DB script.
   a.  copy <db-x.y.z>/lang/php_db4/samples/simple_counter.php to your web
   site.
   b.  run it.  For example, if it's in the root directory:
       http://<path-to-server>/simple_counter.php
   Refresh your page to see the counter increment.

   This example creates a database in /var/tmp.  It can be modified to 
   change the location of the database.
