# Construct a full-text search table containing keywords which are the
# ordinal numbers of the bit positions set for a sequence of integers,
# which are used for the rowid.  There are a total of 30 INSERT and
# DELETE statements, so that we'll test both the segmentMerge() merge
# (over the first 16) and the termSelect() merge (over the level-1
# segment and 14 level-0 segments).
