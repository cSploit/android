# This file implements regression tests for SQLite library.  The
# focus of this file is testing the operation of the library in
# "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL" mode.
#
# Specifically, it tests the case where a connection opens an empty
# file. Then, another connection opens the same file and initializes
# the connection as a WAL database. Following this, the first connection
# executes a "PRAGMA page_size = XXX" command to set its expected page
# size, and then queries the database.
#
# This is an unusual case, as normally SQLite is able to glean the page
# size from the database file as soon as it is opened (even before the
# first read transaction is executed), and the "PRAGMA page_size = XXX"
# is a no-op.
