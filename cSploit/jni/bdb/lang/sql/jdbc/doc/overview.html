SQLite Java Wrapper/JDBC Driver
</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="white">

<A NAME="overview_description">
This is a Java wrapper including a basic JDBC driver
for the <A HREF="http://www.sqlite.org" TARGET="_blank">
SQLite 2/3 database engine</A>.
It is designed using JNI to interface to the SQLite API. That
API is wrapped by methods in the <A HREF="SQLite/Database.html">
SQLite.Database</A> class.
Since June, 2002, it includes a small <A HREF="#jdbc_driver">JDBC driver</A>,
which allows the most basic things to be carried out using the
<TT>java.sql</TT> package.
Since September, 2004, SQLite3 (minimum 3.0.7) is supported. The JNI part can
be generated to include support for both SQLite 2.x and 3.x and detects at
runtime the type of the database.
<P>
The current source tarball can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.ch-werner.de/javasqlite/javasqlite-20120209.tar.gz">
javasqlite-20120209.tar.gz</A>.
It has been tested on Linux, using SQLite 2.8.17 and 3.7.9,
and JDK 1.4/1.5/1.6 from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com" TARGET="_blank">Sun</A>.
The change log starting from August 2007 is <A HREF="ChangeLog">here</A>.
<P>

For rebuilding the following requirements must be met:
<UL>
<LI TYPE="circle">SQLite 2.4.12 or higher
<LI TYPE="circle">JDK 1.1 or higher
<LI TYPE="circle">C compiler and make
</UL>
The source code uses GNU autoconf, thus the build process on UN*X like
systems should look like:
<P>
<PRE>
   $ ./configure
   ...
   $ make
   ...
   $ su -c "make install"
   ...
</PRE>
<P>
To override the directory where configure looks for SQLite and JDK the
configure options <TT>--with-sqlite=DIR</TT>, <TT>--with-sqlite3=DIR</TT>,
and <TT>--with-jdk=DIR</TT> can be used. To specify the place where the
native library (the <TT>libsqlite_jni.so</TT> file) shall be
installed, use the <TT>--prefix=DIR</TT> option. The default place is
<TT>/usr/local/lib</TT>, i.e. the prefix defaults to <TT>/usr/local</TT>.
To specify where the <TT>sqlite.jar</TT> file containing the high-level
part and the JDBC driver shall be
installed, use the <TT>--with-jardir=DIR</TT> option. The default is
<TT>/usr/local/share/java</TT>.
At runtime, it is necessary to tell the JVM both places with
the <TT>-classpath</TT> and <TT>-Djava.library.path=..</TT>
command line options. Optionally, the native part is searched
using the path prefix specified in the <TT>-DSQLite.library.path=..</TT>
property, which has precedence over <TT>-Djava.library.path=..</TT>.
<P>
For Win32 (NT4 or above) the makefiles <TT>javasqlite.mak</TT>,
<TT>javasqlite23.mak</TT>, and <TT>javasqlite3.mak</TT> are provided
in the source archive. These makefiles contain some build
instructions and use the J2SE 1.4.2 from Sun and MS Visual C++ 6.0.
<P>
A DLL with the native JNI part (including SQLite 3.7.7.1)
and the JAR file with the Java part can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.ch-werner.de/javasqlite/javasqlite-20110827-win32.zip">
javasqlite-20110827-win32.zip</A>.
<P>
After successful build and installation a small
<A HREF="test.java">test program</A> can be run by invoking the
following commands (on OJEC replace the <TT>java</TT> command by
<TT>cvm</TT>):
<P>
<PRE>
   $ make test
   ...
   $ java -classpath ... -Djava.library.path=... test
   version: 2.8.17
   ==== local callback ====
   #cols = 5
   col0: type
   col1: name
   ...
</PRE>
<P>
For testing the newer features of SQLite3 (parameter binding with
the help of the <A HREF="SQLite/Stmt.html">SQLite.Stmt</A> class
and incremental blob I/O through <A HREF="SQLite/Blob.html">SQLite.Blob</A>
class) refer to another <A HREF="test3.java">test program</A>.
<P>
A simple shell modelled after that of SQLite can be invoked as
(on OJEC replace the <TT>java</TT> command by <TT>cvm</TT>):
<PRE>
   $ java SQLite.Shell [options] database [sql string]
</PRE>
or using the JAR file
<PRE>
   $ java -jar sqlite.jar [options] database [sql string]
</PRE>
<P>
The native part of the Java SQLite wrapper takes the compile-time
character encoding of the SQLite engine into account, and tries to
map the Java unicode string representation into the system encoding
and vice versa when SQLite has not been built with UTF-8 support.
This can be overriden programatically or by specifying the
<TT>-DSQLite.encoding=x</TT> command line option to the Java
runtime, where <TT>x</TT> must be a charset name recognized
by your Java environment. If the SQLite engine supports UTF-8,
no special options are needed.
<P>
<A NAME="jdbc_driver">
If you like to try the JDBC driver, use <TT>SQLite.JDBCDriver</TT>
as the JDBC drivers's class name. Make sure that you have the
<TT>sqlite.jar</TT> in your class path and the native
library in your java library path. The JDBC URLs to connect to
an SQLite database have the format <TT>jdbc:sqlite:/path</TT>,
where <TT>path</TT> has to be specified as the path
name to the SQLite database, for example
<PRE>
    jdbc:sqlite://dirA/dirB/dbfile
    jdbc:sqlite:/DRIVE:/dirA/dirB/dbfile
    jdbc:sqlite:///COMPUTERNAME/shareA/dirB/dbfile
</PRE>
In order to deal with SQLite's in-memory databases, use a
JDBC URL with this format:
<PRE>
    jdbc:sqlite:/:memory:
</PRE>
For now, the only data types
supported on SQLite tables are <TT>java.lang.String</TT>,
<TT>short</TT>, <TT>int</TT>, <TT>float</TT>, and <TT>double</TT>.

The encoding of SQLite2 databases can be set per
JDBC connection using the connect property <TT>encoding</TT>
when creating the connection.

Partial support exists for <TT>java.sql.Date</TT>,
<TT>java.sql.Time</TT>, and <TT>java.sql.Timestamp</TT>.
For SQLite3 engines the connect property <TT>daterepr</TT>
determines, how date/time/timestamp data is interpreted.
If set to <TT>daterepr=julian</TT>, on INSERT/UPDATE these
datatypes are converted to a floating point number
expressing a julian day number as described in the
<A href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=DateAndTimeFunctions" TARGET="_blank">
SQLite Wiki</A>. On retrieval (SELECT), the floating point
representation is preferred. All other values of the <TT>daterepr</TT>
property use the string formats <TT>YYYY-mm-dd</TT> for date,
<TT>HH:MM:SS</TT> for time, and <TT>YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.f</TT>
for timestamp.

The data type mapping depends mostly on the availability of
the SQLite <TT>PRAGMAs</TT> <TT>show_datatypes</TT> and <TT>table_info</TT>.
Most basic database meta data methods are implemented,
thus enough information is available to access SQLite
databases with JDK >= 1.3 and the
<A HREF="http://www.isqlviewer.com" TARGET="_blank">ISQLViewer</A>
tool.
<P>
A JDBC based benchmark program is built into <TT>sqlite.jar</TT>.
If using a non OJEC version of Java it can be invoked by
<PRE>
   $ java -cp sqlite.jar SQLite.BenchmarkDriver ...
</PRE>
If using an OJEC version of Java it can be invoked by
<PRE>
   $ cvm -cp sqlite.jar SQLite.BenchmarkDataSource ...
</PRE>
For further details see the usage information when invoked without
arguments and consult the source code.

<P>
Stanislaw Ciszewski had also success on MacOSX, see his

Anton Johansson wrote a <A HREF="ajhowto.txt">howto</A> compile
SQLite Java Wrapper for Windows, thanks Anton!
<P>
To find out the SQLite.Database instance of a JDBC connection,
that code snippet can serve as a starting point:
<PRE>
 Connection conn = null;
 SQLite.Database db = null;
 try {
   Class.forName("SQLite.JDBCDriver").newInstance();
   conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:/blabla");
   java.lang.reflect.Method m =
     conn.getClass().getMethod("getSQLiteDatabase", null);
   db = (SQLite.Database) m.invoke(conn, null);
 } catch (Exception e) {
 }
