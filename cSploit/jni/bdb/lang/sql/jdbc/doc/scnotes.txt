Hi,

I've just compiled javasqlite-20070823 on MacOS X. The procedure is as follows:

1) ./configure --with-jdk=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home
2) Edit Makefile and change:
   JNIINCLUDE = -I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers 
3) Add a target
   libsqlite_jni.jnilib: native/sqlite_jni.h native/sqlite_jni.c
   $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) native/sqlite_jni.c -o native/sqlite_jni.o
   $(CC) -dynamiclib -o libsqlite_jni.jnilib native/sqlite_jni.o \
     -framework JavaVM -L/usr/local/lib -lsqlite3 

This is Mac OS specific: libtool which is used in the Makefile produces
a "common" dylib which is not so simple to load under java environment.
/usr/local/lib is path to libsqlite3.dylib in my configuration, other
paths are standard for this OS. 

Till now I've tested test, test3 and shell. All work.

Hope that helps and best regards,
Stanislaw Ciszewski
