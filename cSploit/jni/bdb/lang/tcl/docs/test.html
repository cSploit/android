<A NAME="Debugging"></A>Debugging and Testing</H2>
We have imported the debugging system from the old test suite into the
new interface to aid in debugging problems.&nbsp; There are several variables
that are available both in gdb as globals to the C code, and variables
in Tcl that the user can set.&nbsp; These variables are linked together
so that changes in one venue are reflected in the other.&nbsp; The names
of the variables have been modified a bit to reduce the likelihood
<BR>of namespace trampling.&nbsp; We have added a double underscore to
all the names.
<P>The variables are all initialized to zero (0) thus resulting in debugging
being turned off.&nbsp; The purpose of the debugging, fundamentally, is
to allow the user to set a breakpoint prior to making a DB call.&nbsp;
This breakpoint is set in the <I>__db_loadme() </I>function.&nbsp; The
user may selectively turn on various debugging areas each controlled by
a separate variable (note they all have two (2) underscores prepended to
the name):
<UL>
<LI>
<B>__debug_on</B> - Turns on the debugging system.&nbsp; This must be on
for any debugging to occur</LI>

<LI>
<B>__debug_print - </B>Turns on printing a debug count statement on each
call</LI>

<LI>
<B>__debug_test -</B> Hits the breakpoint in <I>__db_loadme</I> on the
specific iteration</LI>

<LI>
<B>__debug_stop </B>- Hits the breakpoint in <I>__db_loadme</I> on every
(or the next) iteration</LI>
</UL>
<B>Note to developers:</B>&nbsp; Anyone extending this interface must place
a call to <B>_debug_check()</B> (no arguments) before every call into the
DB library.
<P>There is also a command available that will force a call to the _debug_check
function.
<P><B>> berkdb debug_check</B>
<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>For testing purposes we have added several hooks into the DB library
and a small interface into the environment and/or database commands to
manipulate the hooks.&nbsp; This command interface and the hooks and everything
that goes with it is only enabled when the test option is configured into
DB.
<P><B>> &lt;env> test copy <I>location</I></B>
<BR><B>> &lt;db> test copy <I>location</I></B>
<BR><B>> &lt;env> test abort <I>location</I></B>
<BR><B>> &lt;db> test abort <I>location</I></B>
<P>In order to test recovery we need to be able to abort the creation or
deletion process at various points.&nbsp; Also we want to invoke a copy
function to copy the database file(s)&nbsp; at various points as well so
that we can obtain before/after snapshots of the databases.&nbsp; The interface
provides the test command to specify a <B><I>location</I></B> where we
wish to invoke a <B>copy</B> or an <B>abort</B>.&nbsp; The command is available
from either the environment or the database for convenience.&nbsp; The
<B><I>location</I></B>
can be one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>none -</B> Clears the location</LI>

<LI>
<B>preopen -</B> Sets the location prior to the __os_open call in the creation
process</LI>

<LI>
<B>postopen</B> - Sets the location to immediately following the __os_open
call in creation</LI>

<LI>
<B>postlogmeta</B> - Sets the location to immediately following the __db_log_page
call to log the meta data in creation.&nbsp; Only valid for Btree.</LI>

<LI>
<B>postlog</B> - Sets the location to immediately following the last (or
only) __db_log_page call in creation.</LI>

<LI>
<B>postsync</B> - Sets the location to immediately following the sync of
the log page in creation.</LI>

<LI>
<B>prerename</B> - Sets the location prior to the __os_rename call in the
deletion process.</LI>

<LI>
<B>postrename</B> - Sets the location to immediately following the __os_rename
call in deletion</LI>
</UL>
