# 1. Where is the file db.h?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where db.h is
#    installed on your system.

#INCLUDE	= /usr/local/include
#INCLUDE	= ../..
INCLUDE	= /usr/local/BerkeleyDB/include

# 2. Where is libdb?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where libdb is
#    installed on your system.

#LIB	= /usr/local/lib
#LIB	= ../..
LIB	= /usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib

# 3. Is the library called libdb?
#
#    If you have copies of both 1.x and 2.x Berkeley DB installed on
#    your system it can sometimes be tricky to make sure you are using
#    the correct one. Renaming one (or creating a symbolic link) to
#    include the version number of the library can help.
#
#    For example, if you have Berkeley DB 2.6.4  you could rename the
#    Berkeley DB library from libdb.a to libdb-2.6.4.a  and change the
#    DBNAME line below to look like this:
#
#        DBNAME = -ldb-2.6.4 
#
#    Note: If you are building this module with Win32, -llibdb will be
#    used by default.
#
#    If you have changed the name of the library, uncomment the line
#    below (by removing the leading #) and edit the line to use the name
#    you have picked.

#DBNAME = -ldb-3.0

# end of file config.in
