     recursively.

   * passing undef for the flags and/or mode when opening a database could cause

   * DBM filter code beefed up to cope with read-only $_.

1.804 2nd June 2002

   * added documentation patch regarding duplicate keys from Andrew Johnson

   * Added support to allow DB_File to be built with Berkeley DB 3.2 --
     btree_compare, btree_prefix and hash_cb needed to be changed.

   * Updated dbinfo to support Berkeley DB 3.2 file format changes.


1.74 10th December 2000

   * A "close" call in DB_File.xs needed parenthesised to stop win32 from
     thinking it was one of its macros.

   * Updated dbinfo to support Berkeley DB 3.1 file format changes.

   * DB_File.pm & the test hasness now use the warnings pragma (when
     available).

     harness has been updated to reflect this.

   * Added hints/sco.pl

   * The module will now use XSLoader when it is available. When it
     isn't it will use DynaLoader.

     to David Harris for spotting the underlying problem, contributing
     the updates to the documentation and writing DB_File::Lock (available
     on CPAN).

1.71 7th September 1999

   * Fixed a bug that prevented 1.70 from compiling under win32

   * Updated to support Berkeley DB 3.x

   * Updated dbinfo for Berkeley DB 3.x file formats.

   * Added DBM Filter code

1.65 6th March 1999

1.62 30th November 1998

   Added hints/dynixptx.pl.
   Fixed typemap -- 1.61 used PL_na instead of na

1.61 19th November 1998

   Added a note to README about how to build Berkeley DB 2.x when
   using HP-UX.
   Minor modifications to get the module to build with DB 2.5.x
   Fixed a typo in the definition of O_RDONLY, courtesy of Mark Kettenis.

1.60
   Changed the test to check for full tied array support

1.59
   Updated the license section.

   Berkeley DB 2.4.10 disallows zero length keys. Tests 32 & 42 in
   db-btree.t and test 27 in db-hash.t failed because of this change.
   Those tests have been zapped.

   Added dbinfo to the distribution.

1.58
   Tied Array support was enhanced in Perl 5.004_57. DB_File now
   supports PUSH,POP,SHIFT,UNSHIFT & STORESIZE.

   Fixed a problem with the use of sv_setpvn. When the size is
   specified as 0, it does a strlen on the data.  This was ok for DB
   1.x, but isn't for DB 2.x.

1.57
   If Perl has been compiled with Threads support,the symbol op will be
   defined. This clashes with a field name in db.h, so it needs to be
   #undef'ed before db.h is included.

1.56
   Documented the Solaris 2.5 mutex bug

1.55
   Merged 1.16 changes.

1.54

   Fixed a small bug in the test harness when run under win32
   The emulation of fd when useing DB 2.x was busted.

1.53

   Added DB_RENUMBER to flags for recno.

1.52

   Patch from Nick Ing-Simmons now allows DB_File to build on NT.
   Merged 1.15 patch.

1.51

    Fixed the test harness so that it doesn't expect DB_File to have
    been installed by the main Perl build.


    Fixed a bug in mapping 1.x O_RDONLY flag to 2.x DB_RDONLY equivalent

1.50

    DB_File can now build with either DB 1.x or 2.x, but not both at
    the same time.

1.16

   A harmless looking tab was causing Makefile.PL to fail on AIX 3.2.5

    Small fix for the AIX strict C compiler XLC which doesn't like
    __attribute__ being defined via proto.h and redefined via db.h. Fix
    courtesy of Jarkko Hietaniemi.

1.15

    Patch from Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no> to suppress "use of undefined
    value" warning with db_get and db_seq.

    Patch from Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no> to make DB_File export only the
    O_* constants from Fcntl.

    Removed the DESTROY method from the DB_File::HASHINFO module.

    Previously DB_File hard-wired the class name of any object that it
    created to "DB_File". This makes sub-classing difficult. Now
    DB_File creats objects in the namespace of the package it has been
    inherited into.


1.14

    Made it illegal to tie an associative array to a RECNO database and
    an ordinary array to a HASH or BTREE database.

1.13

    Minor changes to DB_FIle.xs and DB_File.pm

1.12

    Documented the incompatibility with version 2 of Berkeley DB.

1.11

    Documented the untie gotcha.

1.10

    Fixed fd method so that it still returns -1 for in-memory files
    when db 1.86 is used.

1.09

    Minor bug fix in DB_File::HASHINFO, DB_File::RECNOINFO and
    DB_File::BTREEINFO.

    Changed default mode to 0666.

1.08

    Documented operation of bval.

1.07

    Fixed bug with RECNO, where bval wasn't defaulting to "\n".

1.06

    Minor namespace cleanup: Localized PrintBtree.

1.05

    Made all scripts in the documentation strict and -w clean.

    Added logic to DB_File.xs to allow the module to be built after
    Perl is installed.

1.04

    Minor documentation changes.

    Fixed a bug in hash_cb. Patches supplied by Dave Hammen,
    <hammen@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.govt>.

    Fixed a bug with the constructors for DB_File::HASHINFO,
    DB_File::BTREEINFO and DB_File::RECNOINFO. Also tidied up the
    constructors to make them -w clean.

    Reworked part of the test harness to be more locale friendly.

1.03

    Documentation update.

    DB_File now imports the constants (O_RDWR, O_CREAT etc.) from Fcntl
    automatically.

    The standard hash function exists is now supported.

    Modified the behavior of get_dup. When it returns an associative
    array, the value is the count of the number of matching BTREE
    values.

1.02

    Merged OS/2 specific code into DB_File.xs

    Removed some redundant code in DB_File.xs.

    Documentation update.

    Allow negative subscripts with RECNO interface.

    Changed the default flags from O_RDWR to O_CREAT|O_RDWR.

    The example code which showed how to lock a database needed a call
    to sync added. Without it the resultant database file was empty.

    Added get_dup method.

1.01

    Fixed a core dump problem with SunOS.

    The return value from TIEHASH wasn't set to NULL when dbopen
    returned an error.

1.0

    DB_File has been in use for over a year. To reflect that, the
    version number has been incremented to 1.0.

    Added complete support for multiple concurrent callbacks.

    Using the push method on an empty list didn't work properly. This
    has been fixed.

0.3

    Added prototype support for multiple btree compare callbacks.

0.2

    When DB_File is opening a database file it no longer terminates the
    process if dbopen returned an error. This allows file protection
    errors to be caught at run time. Thanks to Judith Grass
    <grass@cybercash.com> for spotting the bug.

0.1

    First Release.
