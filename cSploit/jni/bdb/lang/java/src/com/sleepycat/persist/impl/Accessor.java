/**
 * Field binding operations implemented via reflection (ReflectionAccessor) or
 * bytecode enhancement (EnhancedAccessor).
 *
 * <p>Normally we read the set of all secondary key fields first and then the
 * set of all non-key fields, reading each set in order of field name.  But
 * when reading an old format record we must account for the following
 * class evolution conversions:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Convert a field: pass value thru converter</li>
 * <li>Widen a field type: pass value thru widener</li>
 * <li>Add a field: don't read the new field</li>
 * <li>Delete a field: skip the deleted field</li>
 * <li>Rename a field: read field in a different order</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>To support these operations, the methods for reading fields allow reading
 * specific ranges of fields as well as all fields.  For example, all fields
 * up to a deleted field could be read, and then all fields from the following
 * field onward.</p>
