 * ForwardCursor}.
 *
 * <p>The reason for implementing a selector, rather than filtering the objects
 * returned by the {@link ForwardCursor}, is to improve performance when not
 * all keys are to be processed.  Keys are passed to this interface without
 * retrieving record data or locking, so it is less expensive to return false
 * from this method than to retrieve the object from the cursor.</p>
