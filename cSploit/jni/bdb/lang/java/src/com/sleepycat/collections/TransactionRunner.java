/**
 * Starts a transaction, calls {@link TransactionWorker#doWork}, and handles
 * transaction retry and exceptions.  To perform a transaction, the user
 * implements the {@link TransactionWorker} interface and passes an instance of
 * that class to the {@link #run run} method.
 *
 * <p>A single TransactionRunner instance may be used by any number of threads
 * for any number of transactions.</p>
 *
 * <p>The behavior of the run() method depends on whether the environment is
 * transactional, whether nested transactions are enabled, and whether a
 * transaction is already active.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>When the run() method is called in a transactional environment and no
 * transaction is active for the current thread, a new transaction is started
 * before calling doWork().  If DeadlockException is thrown by doWork(),
 * the transaction will be aborted and the process will be repeated up to the
 * maximum number of retries.  If another exception is thrown by doWork() or
 * the maximum number of retries has occurred, the transaction will be aborted
 * and the exception will be rethrown by the run() method.  If no exception is
 * thrown by doWork(), the transaction will be committed.  The run() method
 * will not attempt to commit or abort a transaction if it has already been
 * committed or aborted by doWork().</li>
 *
 * <li>When the run() method is called and a transaction is active for the
 * current thread, and nested transactions are enabled, a nested transaction is
 * started before calling doWork().  The transaction that is active when
 * calling the run() method will become the parent of the nested transaction.
 * The nested transaction will be committed or aborted by the run() method
 * following the same rules described above.  Note that nested transactions may
 * not be enabled for the JE product, since JE does not support nested
 * transactions.</li>
 *
 * <li>When the run() method is called in a non-transactional environment, the
 * doWork() method is called without starting a transaction.  The run() method
 * will return without committing or aborting a transaction, and any exceptions
 * thrown by the doWork() method will be thrown by the run() method.</li>
 *
 * <li>When the run() method is called and a transaction is active for the
 * current thread and nested transactions are not enabled (the default) the
 * same rules as above apply. All the operations performed by the doWork()
 * method will be part of the currently active transaction.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In a transactional environment, the rules described above support nested
 * calls to the run() method and guarantee that the outermost call will cause
 * the transaction to be committed or aborted.  This is true whether or not
 * nested transactions are supported or enabled.  Note that nested transactions
 * are provided as an optimization for improving concurrency but do not change
 * the meaning of the outermost transaction.  Nested transactions are not
 * currently supported by the JE product.</p>
