/**
 * Indicates a secondary key field of an entity class.  The value of the
 * secondary key field is a unique or non-unique identifier for the entity and
 * is accessed via a {@link com.sleepycat.persist.SecondaryIndex}.
 *
 * <p>{@code SecondaryKey} may appear on any number of fields in an entity
 * class, subclasses and superclasses.  For a secondary key field in the entity
 * class or one of its superclasses, all entity instances will be indexed by
 * that field (if it is non-null).  For a secondary key field in an entity
 * subclass, only instances of that subclass will be indexed by that field (if
 * it is non-null).</p>
 *
 * <p>If a secondary key field is null, the entity will not be indexed by that
 * key.  In other words, the entity cannot be queried by that secondary key nor
 * can the entity be found by iterating through the secondary index.</p>
 *
 * <p>For a given entity class and its superclasses and subclasses, no two
 * secondary keys may have the same name.  By default, the field name
 * identifies the secondary key and the secondary index for a given entity
 * class.  {@link #name} may be specified to override this default.</p>
 *
 * <p>Using {@link #relate}, instances of the entity class are related to
 * secondary keys in a many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, or one-to-one
 * relationship.  This required property specifies the <em>cardinality</em> of
 * each side of the relationship.</p>
 *
 * <p>A secondary key may optionally be used to form a relationship with
 * instances of another entity class using {@link #relatedEntity} and {@link
 * #onRelatedEntityDelete}.  This establishes <em>foreign key constraints</em>
 * for the secondary key.</p>
 *
 * <p>The secondary key field type must be a Set, Collection or array type when
 * a <em>x-to-many</em> relationship is used or a singular type when an
 * <em>x-to-one</em> relationship is used; see {@link #relate}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The field type (or element type, when a Set, Collection or array type is
 * used) of a secondary key field must follow the same rules as for a {@link
 * <a href="PrimaryKey.html#keyTypes">primary key type</a>}.  The {@link <a
 * href="PrimaryKey.html#sortOrder">key sort order</a>} is also the same.</p>
 *
 * <p>For a secondary key field with a collection type, a type parameter must
 * be used to specify the element type.  For example {@code Collection<String>}
 * is allowed but {@code Collection} is not.</p>

     * field must be a Set, Collection or array type.  A collection type is any

     * <p>When a related entity class is specified, a check (foreign key

     *
     * <p>Whenever a new secondary key value is stored for this entity, it is
