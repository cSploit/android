/**
A secondary database handle.
<p>
Secondary databases are opened with {@link
Environment#openSecondaryDatabase Environment.openSecondaryDatabase} and are
always associated with a single primary database.  The distinguishing
characteristics of a secondary database are:
<ul>
<li>Records are automatically added to a secondary database when records are
added, modified and deleted in the primary database.  Direct calls to
<code>put()</code> methods on a secondary database are prohibited.</li>
<li>The {@link #delete delete} method of a secondary database will delete
the primary record and as well as all its associated secondary records.</li>
<li>Calls to all <code>get()</code> methods will return the data from the
associated primary database.</li>
<li>Additional <code>get()</code> method signatures are provided to return
the primary key in an additional <code>pKey</code> parameter.</li>
<li>Calls to {@link #openCursor openCursor} will return a {@link
SecondaryCursor}, which itself has <code>get()</code> methods that return
the data of the primary database and additional <code>get()</code> method
signatures for returning the primary key.</li>
<li>The {@link #openSecondaryCursor openSecondaryCursor} method is provided
to return a {@link SecondaryCursor} that doesn't require casting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before opening or creating a secondary database you must implement the {@link
SecondaryKeyCreator}
interface.
<p>
For example, to create a secondary database that supports duplicates:
<pre>
    Database primaryDb; // The primary database must already be open.
    SecondaryKeyCreator keyCreator; // Your key creator implementation.
    SecondaryConfig secConfig = new SecondaryConfig();
    secConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
    secConfig.setSortedDuplicates(true);
    secConfig.setKeyCreator(keyCreator);
    SecondaryDatabase newDb = env.openSecondaryDatabase(transaction,
                                                        "myDatabaseName",
                                                        primaryDb,
                                                        secConfig)
</pre>
<p>
If a primary database is to be associated with one or more secondary
databases, it may not be configured for duplicates.
<p>
Note that the associations between primary and secondary databases are not
stored persistently.  Whenever a primary database is opened for write access by
the application, the appropriate associated secondary databases should also be
opened by the application.  This is necessary to ensure data integrity when
changes are made to the primary database.

    /**
    Open a database.
<p>
The database is represented by the file and database parameters.
<p>
The currently supported database file formats (or <em>access
methods</em>) are Btree, Hash, Queue, and Recno.  The Btree format is a
representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.  The Hash format
is an extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.  The Queue format supports
fast access to fixed-length records accessed sequentially or by logical
record number.  The Recno format supports fixed- or variable-length
records, accessed sequentially or by logical record number, and
optionally backed by a flat text file.
<p>
Storage and retrieval are based on key/data pairs; see {@link com.sleepycat.db.DatabaseEntry DatabaseEntry}
for more information.
<p>
Opening a database is a relatively expensive operation, and maintaining
a set of open databases will normally be preferable to repeatedly
opening and closing the database for each new query.
<p>
In-memory databases never intended to be preserved on disk may be
created by setting both the fileName and databaseName parameters to
null.  Note that in-memory databases can only ever be shared by sharing
the single database handle that created them, in circumstances where
doing so is safe.  The environment variable <code>TMPDIR</code> may
be used as a directory in which to create temporary backing files.
<p>
@param fileName
The name of an underlying file that will be used to back the database.
On Windows platforms, this argument will be interpreted as a UTF-8
string, which is equivalent to ASCII for Latin characters.
<p>
@param databaseName
An optional parameter that allows applications to have multiple
databases in a single file.  Although no databaseName parameter needs
to be specified, it is an error to attempt to open a second database in
a physical file that was not initially created using a databaseName
parameter.  Further, the databaseName parameter is not supported by the
Queue format.
<p>
@param primaryDatabase
a database handle for the primary database that is to be indexed.
<p>
@param config The secondary database open attributes.  If null, default attributes are used.
