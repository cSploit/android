    sorting orders or hashing functions, first perform verification of
    the file as a whole using {@link com.sleepycat.db.Database#verify Database.verify} configured with
    {@link com.sleepycat.db.VerifyConfig#setNoOrderCheck VerifyConfig.setNoOrderCheck}, and then individually verify
    the sort order and hashing function for each database in the file
