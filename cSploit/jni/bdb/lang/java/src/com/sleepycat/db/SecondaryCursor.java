/**
A database cursor for a secondary database. Cursors are not thread safe
and the application is responsible for coordinating any multithreaded
access to a single cursor object.
<p>
Secondary cursors are returned by
{@link SecondaryDatabase#openCursor SecondaryDatabase.openCursor} and
{@link SecondaryDatabase#openSecondaryCursor
SecondaryDatabase.openSecondaryCursor}.  The distinguishing characteristics
of a secondary cursor are:
<ul>
<li>Direct calls to <code>put()</code> methods on a secondary cursor are
prohibited.
<li>The {@link #delete} method of a secondary cursor will delete the primary
record and as well as all its associated secondary records.
<li>Calls to all get methods will return the data from the associated
primary database.
<li>Additional get method signatures are provided to return the primary key
in an additional pKey parameter.
<li>Calls to {@link #dup} will return a {@link SecondaryCursor}.
<li>The {@link #dupSecondary} method is provided to return a {@link
SecondaryCursor} that doesn't require casting.
</ul>
<p>
To obtain a secondary cursor with default attributes:
<blockquote><pre>
    SecondaryCursor cursor = myDb.openSecondaryCursor(txn, null);
</pre></blockquote>
To customize the attributes of a cursor, use a CursorConfig object.
<blockquote><pre>
    CursorConfig config = new CursorConfig();
    config.setDirtyRead(true);
    SecondaryCursor cursor = myDb.openSecondaryCursor(txn, config);
</pre></blockquote>
