 * A marshalling interface implemented by key, data or entity classes that

 * <p>Key classes implement this interface to marshal their key entry.  Data or
 * entity classes implement this interface to marshal their data entry.
 * Implementations of this interface must have a public no arguments
 * constructor so that they can be instantiated by a binding, prior to calling
 * the {@link #unmarshalEntry} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that implementing this interface is not necessary when the object is
 * a Java simple type, for example: String, Integer, etc. These types can be
 * used with built-in bindings returned by {@link
 * TupleBinding#getPrimitiveBinding}.</p>
