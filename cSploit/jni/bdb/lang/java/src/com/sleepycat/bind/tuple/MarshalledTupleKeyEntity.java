 * <p>Note that a marshalled tuple key extractor is somewhat less efficient
 * than a non-marshalled key tuple extractor because more conversions are
 * needed.  A marshalled key extractor must convert the entry to an object in
 * order to extract the key fields, while an unmarshalled key extractor does
 * not.</p>
