/**
Creates a database handle for a single Berkeley DB database. 
A Berkeley DB database provides a mechanism for organizing key-data pairs 
of information. From the perspective of some database systems, a Berkeley DB database 
could be thought of as a single table within a larger database.
<p>
For most database activities, you must open the handle using the 
open method. When you are done 
with them, handles must be closed using the close method.
<p>
It is possible to create databases such that they are organized within a 
database environment. Environments are optional for simple Berkeley DB applications 
that do not use transactions, recovery, replication or any other advanced features. 
For simple Berkeley DB applications, environments still offer some advantages. 
For example, they provide some organizational benefits on-disk (all databases 
are located on disk relative to the environment). Also, if you are using 
multiple databases, then environments allow your databases to share a 
common in-memory cache, which makes for more efficient usage of your hardware's resources.
See {@link com.sleepycat.db.Environment Environment}
for information on using database environments.
<p>
Database handles are free-threaded unless opened in an environment
that is not free-threaded.
<p>
Database attributes are specified in the {@link com.sleepycat.db.DatabaseConfig DatabaseConfig} class.
<p>
To open an existing database with default attributes:
<blockquote><pre>
    Environment env = new Environment(home, null);
    Database myDatabase = env.openDatabase(null, "mydatabase", null);
</pre></blockquote>
To create a transactional database that supports duplicates:
<blockquote><pre>
    DatabaseConfig dbConfig = new DatabaseConfig();
    dbConfig.setTransactional(true);
    dbConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
    dbConfig.setSortedDuplicates(true);
    Database newlyCreateDb = env.openDatabase(txn, "mydatabase", dbConfig);
</pre></blockquote>

    Open a database.
<p>
The database is represented by the file and database parameters.
<p>
The currently supported database file formats (or <em>access
methods</em>) are Btree, Hash, Queue, and Recno.  The Btree format is a
representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.  The Hash format
is an extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.  The Queue format supports
fast access to fixed-length records accessed sequentially or by logical
record number.  The Recno format supports fixed- or variable-length
records, accessed sequentially or by logical record number, and
optionally backed by a flat text file.
<p>
Storage and retrieval are based on key/data pairs; see {@link com.sleepycat.db.DatabaseEntry DatabaseEntry}
for more information.
<p>
Opening a database is a relatively expensive operation, and maintaining
a set of open databases will normally be preferable to repeatedly
opening and closing the database for each new query.
<p>
In-memory databases never intended to be preserved on disk may be
created by setting both the fileName and databaseName parameters to
null.  Note that in-memory databases can only ever be shared by sharing
the single database handle that created them, in circumstances where
doing so is safe.  The environment variable <code>TMPDIR</code> may
be used as a directory in which to create temporary backing files.
<p>
@param filename
The name of an underlying file that will be used to back the database.
On Windows platforms, this argument will be interpreted as a UTF-8
string, which is equivalent to ASCII for Latin characters.
<p>
@param databaseName
An optional parameter that allows applications to have multiple
databases in a single file.  Although no databaseName parameter needs
to be specified, it is an error to attempt to open a second database in
a physical file that was not initially created using a databaseName
parameter.  Further, the databaseName parameter is not supported by the
Queue format.
<p>
@param config The database open attributes.  If null, default attributes are used.

Flush any cached database information to disk, close any open cursors, 
free allocated resources, close underlying files, and discard the database handle.
<p>
Although closing a database handle will close any open cursors, it is 
recommended that applications explicitly close all their {@link com.sleepycat.db.Cursor Cursor} 
handles before closing the database. The reason why is that when the cursor 
is explicitly closed, the memory allocated for it is reclaimed; however, 
this will not happen if you close a database while cursors are still open.
The same rule, for the same reasons, hold true for 
{@link com.sleepycat.db.Transaction Transaction} handles. 
Make sure you close all your transaction handles before closing your database handle.
<p>
Because key/data pairs are cached in memory, failing to sync the file
with the {@link com.sleepycat.db.Database#close Database.close} or {@link com.sleepycat.db.Database#sync Database.sync} methods
may result in inconsistent or lost information.
So, to ensure that any data cached in main memory are reflected 
in the underlying file system, applications should make a point to 
always either close database handles or sync their data to disk.

concurrently, only a single thread may call this method.
<p>
The database handle may not be accessed again after this method is
called, regardless of the method's success or failure.
<p>
When called on a database that is the primary database for a secondary
index, the primary database should be closed only after all secondary
indices which reference it have been closed.
If you do not close the database handle explicitly, 
it will be closed when the environment handle that owns the database handle is closed.
@param noSync
Do not flush cached information to disk.  The noSync parameter is a
dangerous option.  It should be set only if the application is doing
logging (with transactions) so that the database is recoverable after a
system or application crash, or if the database is always generated from
scratch after any system or application crash.
<b>
It is important to understand that flushing cached information to disk
only minimizes the window of opportunity for corrupted data.
<p>
</b>
Although unlikely, it is possible for database corruption to happen if
a system or application crash occurs while writing data to the database.
To ensure that database corruption never occurs, applications must
either: use transactions and logging with automatic recovery; use
logging and application-specific recovery; or edit a copy of the
database, and once all applications using the database have successfully
called this method, atomically replace the original database with the
updated copy.

Note that this flag only works when the database has been opened using an environment.

    </b>
    <p>
    As part of the upgrade from the Berkeley DB 3.0 release to the 3.1
    release, the on-disk format of duplicate data items changed.  To
    correctly upgrade the format requires applications to specify
    whether duplicate data items in the database are sorted or not.
    Configuring the database object to support sorted duplicates by the
    {@link com.sleepycat.db.DatabaseConfig#setSortedDuplicates DatabaseConfig.setSortedDuplicates} method informs this
    method that the duplicates are sorted; otherwise they are assumed
    to be unsorted.  Incorrectly specifying this configuration
    information may lead to database corruption.
    <p>
    Further, because this method upgrades a physical file (including all
    the databases it contains), it is not possible to use this method
    to upgrade files in which some of the databases it includes have
    sorted duplicate data items, and some of the databases it includes
    have unsorted duplicate data items.  If the file does not have more
    than a single database, if the databases do not support duplicate
    data items, or if all of the databases that support duplicate data
    items support the same style of duplicates (either sorted or
    unsorted), this method will work correctly as long as the duplicate
    configuration is correctly specified.  Otherwise, the file cannot
    be upgraded using this method; it must be upgraded manually by
    dumping and reloading the databases.
    <p>
    Unlike all other database operations, upgrades may only be done on
    a system with the same byte-order as the database.
