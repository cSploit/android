/**
The Transaction object is the handle for a transaction.  Methods off the
transaction handle are used to configure, abort and commit the
transaction.  Transaction handles are provided to other Berkeley DB
methods in order to transactionally protect those operations.
<p>
Transaction handles are not free-threaded; transactions handles may
be used by multiple threads, but only serially, that is, the application
must serialize access to the handle.  Once the
{@link com.sleepycat.db.Transaction#abort Transaction.abort}, {@link com.sleepycat.db.Transaction#commit Transaction.commit} or
{@link com.sleepycat.db.Transaction#discard Transaction.discard}
methods are called, the handle may
not be accessed again (except to retrieve the commit token),
regardless of the success or failure of the method.
In addition, parent transactions may not issue any Berkeley DB operations
while they have active child transactions (child transactions that have
not yet been committed or aborted) except for {@link com.sleepycat.db.Environment#beginTransaction Environment.beginTransaction}, {@link com.sleepycat.db.Transaction#abort Transaction.abort} and {@link com.sleepycat.db.Transaction#commit Transaction.commit}.
<p>
To obtain a transaction with default attributes:
<blockquote><pre>
    Transaction txn = myEnvironment.beginTransaction(null, null);
</pre></blockquote>
To customize the attributes of a transaction:
<blockquote><pre>
    TransactionConfig config = new TransactionConfig();
    config.setDirtyRead(true);
    Transaction txn = myEnvironment.beginTransaction(null, config);
</pre></blockquote>
