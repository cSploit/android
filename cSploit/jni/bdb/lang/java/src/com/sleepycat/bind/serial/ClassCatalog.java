 * When serialized objects are stored in a database, a {@link
 * StoredClassCatalog} should be used.</p>
 *
 * <p>This information is used for serialization of class descriptors or

 * format.  For each unique format, a unique class ID is assigned by the

 * of the full class information.  When used with {@link SerialInput} and
 * {@link SerialOutput} or any of the serial bindings, the use of the catalog
 * is transparent to the application.</p>
