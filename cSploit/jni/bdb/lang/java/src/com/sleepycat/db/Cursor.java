/**
A database cursor. Cursors are used for operating on collections of
records, for iterating over a database, and for saving handles to
individual records, so that they can be modified after they have been
read.
<p>
Cursors may be used by multiple threads, but only serially.  That is,
the application must serialize access to the handle.
<p>
If the cursor is to be used to perform operations on behalf of a
transaction, the cursor must be opened and closed within the context of
that single transaction.
<p>
If you do not close the cursor before closing the database handle or the 
transaction handle that owns this cursor, then, closing a database 
handle or a transaction handle closes these open cursors.
Once the cursor close method has been called, the handle may not be
accessed again, regardless of the close method's success or failure.
<p>
To obtain a cursor with default attributes:
<blockquote><pre>
    Cursor cursor = myDatabase.openCursor(txn, null);
</pre></blockquote>
To customize the attributes of a cursor, use a CursorConfig object.
<blockquote><pre>
    CursorConfig config = new CursorConfig();
    config.setDirtyRead(true);
    Cursor cursor = myDatabase.openCursor(txn, config);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Modifications to the database during a sequential scan will be reflected
in the scan; that is, records inserted behind a cursor will not be
returned while records inserted in front of a cursor will be returned.
In Queue and Recno databases, missing entries (that is, entries that
were never explicitly created or that were created and then deleted)
will be ignored during a sequential scan.

    database handle or the transaction handle that owns this cursor because
    closing a database handle or transaction handle closes those open cursor.
