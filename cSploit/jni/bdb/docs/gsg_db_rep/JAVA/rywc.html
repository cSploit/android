      <p>
            In a distributed system, the changes made at the master are not
            always instantaneously available at every replica, although
            they eventually will be. In general, replicas not directly
            involved in contributing to the acknowledgement of a
            transaction commit will lag behind other replicas because they
            do not synchronize their commits with the master.
        </p>
      <p>
            For this reason, you might want to make use of the
            read-your-writes consistency feature. This feature allows you
            to ensure that a  replica is at least current enough to have the
            changes made by a specific transaction.  Because transactions
            are applied serially, by ensuring a replica has a specific
            commit applied to it, you know that all transaction commits
            occurring prior to the specified transaction have also been
            applied to the replica.
        </p>
      <p>
            You determine whether a transaction has been applied to a replica by
            generating a <span class="emphasis"><em>commit token</em></span> at the master.
            You then transfer this commit token to the replica, where it is
            used to determine whether the replica is consistent enough
            relative to the master.
        </p>
      <p>
            For example, suppose the you have a web application
            where a replication group is implemented within a load
            balanced web server group. Each request to the web server
            consists of an update operation followed by read operations
            (say, from the same client), The read operations naturally
            expect to see the data from the updates executed by the
            same request. However, the read operations might have been
            routed to a replica that did not execute the update.
        </p>
      <p>
            In such a case, the update request would generate a commit
            token, which would be resubmitted by the browser, along with
            subsequent read requests. The read request could be directed at
            any one of the available web servers by a load balancer. The
            replica which services the read request would use that commit
            token to determine whether it can service the read
            operation.  If the replica is current enough, it can
            immediately execute the transaction and satisfy the request.
        </p>
      <p>
            What action the replica takes if it is not consistent enough to
            service the read request is up to you as the application
            developer. You can do anything from blocking while you wait
            for the transaction to be applied locally, to rejecting the
            read request outright.
