                    As stated in the previous section, when a replication
                    replica is synchronizing with its master, it will block
                    DB operations at some points during this process
                    until the synchronization is completed. You can turn
                    off this behavior (see <a class="xref" href="manageblock.html" title="Managing Blocking Operations">Managing Blocking Operations</a>), but for replicas
                    that have been out of touch from their master for a
                    very long time, this may not be enough.

            </p>
      <p>
                    If a replica has been out of touch from its master long enough, it may find that
                    it is not possible to perform synchronization. When this happens, by default the
                    master and replica internally decide to completely re-initialize the replica.
                    This re-initialization involves discarding the replica's current database(s) and
                    transferring new ones to it from the master. Depending on the size of the master's
                    databases, this can take a long time, during which time the replica will be
                    completely non-responsive when it comes to performing database operations.
            </p>
      <p>
                It is possible that there is a time of the day when it is better to perform a replica
                re-initialization. Or, you simply might want to decide to bring the replica up to
                speed by restoring its databases using a hot-backup taken from the master. Either
                way, you can decide to prevent automatic-initialization of your replica. To do this
                specify
                    <span>
                        <code class="literal">DB_REP_CONF_AUTOINIT</code> to
                            <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_config()</code>
                            
                        and then specify <code class="literal">0</code> to the <code class="literal">onoff</code>
                        parameter.
                    </span>
                    
            </p>
