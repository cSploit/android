      <p>
        As described above, you introduce replication to an application by
        starting with a transactional application, performing some basic
        replication configuration, and then starting replication using 
        
        <span><code class="methodname">DbEnv::repmgr_start()</code>.</span>
        
    </p>
      <p>
        You stop replication by closing your environment
        cleanly in the same way you would for any DB application.
    </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following code fragment initializes, then
        stops and starts replication. Note that other replication
        activities are omitted for brevity.

                <span><code class="methodname">DbEnv::repgmr_start()</code>.</span>
                These flags control how your replication application will
                behave when it first starts up.
                </span>

                
            </p>
        <p>
                    In the previous example, we specified 
                        <code class="literal">DB_REP_ELECTION</code>
                        
                    when we started replication. This causes the
                    application to try to find a master upon startup. If it
                    cannot, it calls for an election. In the event an
                    election is held, the environment receiving the most number of
                    votes will become the master.
            </p>
        <p>
                    There's some important points to make here:

        <div class="itemizedlist">

            <li>

                                    only requires that other
                                    environments in the replication group
                                    participate in the vote. There is no
                                    requirement that
                                    <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> such
                                    environments participate. In other
                                    words, if an environment
                                    starts up, it can call for an
                                    election, and select a master, even 
                                    if all other environment have not yet
                                    joined the  replication group.

              <p>
                                    It only requires a simple majority of
                                    participating environments to elect a master. 
                                    This is always true of elections held using the Replication Manager.
                            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                                    As always, the environment participating in the election with the most
                                    up-to-date log files is selected as
                                    master. If an environment with more recent log files
                                    has not yet joined the replication
                                    group, it may not become the master.
                            </p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                    Any one of these points may be enough to cause a
                    less-than-optimum environment to be selected as master.
                    Therefore, to give you a better degree of control over
                    which environment becomes a master at application startup,
                    the Replication Manager offers the following start-up

                   than one environment to start up using this flag, or for
                   an environment

                           In the event that a environment attempts to become a

                           replication code will resolve the problem by
                           holding an election. Note, however, that there
                           is always a possibility of data loss in the face
                           of duplicate masters, because once a master is
                           selected, the environment that loses the election will
                           have to roll back any transactions committed
                           until it is in sync with the "real" master.

                    Under the hood, the Replication Manager is threaded and you can
                    control the number of threads used to process messages received from
                    other replicas. The threads that the Replication Manager uses are:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                                    Incoming message thread. This thread
                                    receives messages from the site's
                                    socket and passes those messages to
                                    message processing threads (see below)
                                    for handling.
                            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                                    Outgoing message thread. Outgoing
                                    messages are sent from whatever thread
                                    performed a write to the database(s).
                                    That is, the thread that called, for
                                    example, 
                                    
                                    <code class="methodname">Db::put()</code>
                                    
                                    is the thread that writes replication messages
                                    about that fact to the socket. 
                            </p>
              <p>
                                    Note that if this write activity would
                                    cause the thread to be blocked due to
                                    some condition on the socket, the Replication Manager
                                    will hand the outgoing message to the
                                    incoming message thread, and it will
                                    then write the message to the socket.
                                    This prevents your database write
                                    threads from blocking due to abnormal
                                    network I/O conditions.
                            </p>

              <p>
                                    Message processing threads are
                                    responsible for parsing and then
                                    responding to incoming replication
                                    messages. Typically, a response will
                                    include write activity to your
                                    database(s), so these threads can be
                                    busy performing disk I/O.
                            </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                    Of these threads, the only ones that you have any
                    configuration control over are the message processing
                    threads. In this case, you can determine how many
                    of these threads you want to run.
            </p>
        <p>
                    It is always a bit of an art to decide on a thread count,
                    but the short answer is you probably do not need more
                    than three threads here, and it is likely that one will
                    suffice. That said, the best thing to do is set your
                    thread count to a fairly low number and then increase
                    it if it appears that your application will benefit
                    from the additional threads.
