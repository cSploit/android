                        Typically the central part of any replication application
                        is some sort of a continuous loop that constantly
                        checks the state of the environment (whether it is a
                        replica or a master), opens and/or closes the
                        databases as is necessary, and performs other useful
                        work. A loop such as this one must of necessity
                        take special care to know whether it is operating
                        on a master or a replica environment because all of its
                        activities are dependent upon that state.
                  </p>
      <p>
                          The flow of activities through the loop will
                          generally be as follows:
                  </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                                          Check whether the environment has
                                          changed state. If it has, you
                                          might want to reopen your
                                          database handles, especially if
                                          you opened your replica's
                                          database handles as read-only. 
                                          In this case, you might need to
                                          reopen them as read-write.
                                          However, if you always open your
                                          database handles as read-write,
                                          then it is not automatically necessary to
                                          reopen the databases due to a
                                          state change.  Instead, you
                                          could check for a
                                          <span>
                                            <code class="literal">DB_REP_HANDLE_DEAD</code>
                                            return code
                                          </span>
                                          

                                          when you use your
                                          database handle(s). If you see
                                          this, then you need to reopen
                                          your database handle(s). 
                                  </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                                          If the databases are closed,
                                          create new database handles,
                                          configure the handle as is
                                          appropriate, and then open the
                                          databases. Note that handle
                                          configuration will be different,
                                          depending on whether the handle
                                          is opened as a replica or a
                                          master. At a minimum, the master
                                          should be opened with database
                                          creation privileges, whereas the
                                          replica does not need to be. You
                                          must also open the master such
                                          that its databases are
                                          read-write. You
                                          <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> open
                                          replicas with read-only
                                          databases, so long as you are
                                          prepared to close and then reopen
                                          the handle in the event the
                                          client becomes a master.
                                  </p>
            <p>
                                          Also, note that if the local
                                          environment 
                                          is a replica, then it is possible
                                          that databases do not currently
                                          exist. In this case, the database
                                          open attempts will fail. Your
                                          code will have to take this
                                          corner case into account
                                          (described below).
                                  </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                                        Once the databases are opened,
                                        check to see if the local
                                        environment is a
                                        master. If it is, do whatever it is
                                        a master should do for your
                                        application.
                                  </p>
            <p>
                                          Remember that the code for your
                                          master should include some way
                                          for you to tell the master 
                                          to exit gracefully.
                                  </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                                          If the local environment is not a
                                          master, then do whatever it is
                                          your replica environments should do.
                                          Again, like the code for your
                                          master environments, you should provide
                                          a way for your replicas to exit
                                          the processing loop gracefully.
                                  </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

                          The following code fragment illustrates
                          these points (note that we fill out this
