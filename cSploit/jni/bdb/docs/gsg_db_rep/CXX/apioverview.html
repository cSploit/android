                There are two ways that you can choose to implement
                replication in your transactional application. The first,
                and preferred, mechanism is to use the pre-packaged
                Replication Manager that comes with the
                DB distribution. This framework should be sufficient
                for most customers.
            </p>
      <p>
                If for some reason the Replication Manager
                does not meet your application's technical requirements,
                you will have to use the Replication Base APIs available
                through the Berkeley DB  library to write your own custom
                replication framework. 
            </p>
      <p>
                Both of these approaches are described in slightly greater
                detail in this section. The bulk of the chapters later in
                this book are dedicated to these two replication
                implementation mechanisms.

                    DB's pre-packaged Replication Manager exists
                    as a layer on top of the DB library. The Replication Manager is a
                    multi-threaded implementation that allows you to easily add
                    replication to your existing transactional application.
                    <span>
                    You access and manage the Replication Manager using methods that are
                    available off the

                            Provides a multi-threaded communications layer
                            using pthreads (on Unix-style systems and
                            similar derivatives such as Mac OS X), or
                            Windows threads on Microsoft Windows systems.

                                Uses TCP/IP sockets. Network traffic is
                                handled via threads that handle inbound and
                                outbound messages.  However, each
                               process uses a single socket
                               that is shared using <code class="function">select()</code>.

              <p>
                                Note that for this reason, the Replication Manager is
                                limited to a maximum of 60 replicas (on
                                Windows) and approximately 1000 replicas (on
                                Unix and related systems), depending on how
                                your system is configured.

                            Upon application startup, a master can be
                            selected either manually or via elections.
                            After startup time, however, during the course of 
                            normal operations it is possible for the
                            replication group to need to locate a new master (due
                            to network or other hardware related problems,
                            for example).

                    If your application has technical requirements that do
                    not conform to the implementation provided by the
                    Replication Manager, you must write implement replication
                    using the DB Replication Base APIs. See
                    the next section for introductory details.

        <p>
                    The Replication Base API is a series of Berkeley DB library
                    classes and methods that you can use to build your own
                    replication infrastructure. You should use the
                    Base API only if the Replication Manager does not meet your
                    application's technical requirements.
                </p>
        <p>
                    To make use of the Base API, you must write your
                    own networking code. This frees you from the technical
                    constraints imposed by the Replication Manager. For example, by
                    writing your own framework, you can:

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                                        Use a threading package other than
                                        pthreads (Unix) or Windows threads
                                        (Microsoft Windows). This might be interesting
                                        to you if you are using a platform
                                        whose preferred threading package
                                        is something other than (for
                                        example) pthreads, such as is the case for 
                                        Sun Microsystem's Solaris operating systems.

                                        Implement your own sockets. The
                                        Replication Manager uses TCP/IP sockets. While
                                        this should be acceptable for the
                                        majority of applications, sometimes
                                        UDP or even raw sockets might be
                                        desired.
