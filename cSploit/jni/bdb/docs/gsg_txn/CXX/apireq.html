            In order to use transactions, your application has certain
            requirements beyond what is required of non-transactional protected
            applications.  They are:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    Environments.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Environments are optional for non-transactional
                    applications, but they are required for transactional
                    applications.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Environment usage is described in detail in

                </p>
            <p>
                    In order to use transactions, you must explicitly
                    enable the transactional subsystem for your
                    application, and this must be done at the time that
                    your environment is first created.

                    Logging subsystem.
                </p>
            <p>
                    The logging subsystem is required for recovery purposes, but
                    its usage also means your application may require a
                    little more administrative effort than it does when logging
                    is not in use. See <a class="xref" href="filemanagement.html" title="Chapter 5. Managing DB Files">Managing DB Files</a> for more information.

                    <span>DbTxn</span>
                    
                    
                    handles.
                </p>
            <p>
                    In order to obtain the atomicity guarantee offered by
                    the transactional subsystem (that is, combine multiple
                    operations in a single unit of work), your application must use
                    transaction handles.  These handles are obtained from your 
                    
                    <span>DbEnv</span>
                    
                    
                    objects. They should normally be short-lived, and their usage is 
                    reasonably simple. To complete a transaction and save
                    the work it performed, you 
                    call its <code class="methodname">commit()</code> method. To
                    complete a transaction and discard its work, you call its
                    <code class="methodname">abort()</code> method.
                </p>
            <p>
                    In addition, it is possible to use auto commit if you want
                    to transactional protect a single write operation. Auto
                    commit allows a transaction to be used without 
                    obtaining an explicit transaction handle. See 
                    <a class="xref" href="autocommit.html" title="Auto Commit">Auto Commit</a>
                    for information on how to use auto commit.

                    if subsequent operations on the databases are to be transaction
                    protected. The database open and secondary index
                    association are commonly transaction protected using
                    auto commit.

                    Deadlock detection.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Typically transactional applications use multiple
                    threads of control when accessing the database. 
                    Any time multiple threads are used on a single resource,
                    the potential for lock contention arises. In turn, lock
                    contention can lead to deadlocks. See
                    <a class="xref" href="blocking_deadlocks.html" title="Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks">Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks</a>
                    for more information.
                </p>
            <p>
                    Therefore, transactional applications must frequently
                    include code for detecting and responding to deadlocks.
                    Note that this requirement is not
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>specific</em></span> to transactions
                    – you can certainly write concurrent
                    non-transactional DB applications. Further, not
                    every transactional application uses concurrency and
                    so not every transactional application must
                    manage deadlocks. Still, deadlock management is so
                    frequently a characteristic of transactional
                    applications that we discuss it in this
                    book. See <a class="xref" href="txnconcurrency.html" title="Chapter 4. Concurrency">Concurrency</a>
                    for more information.
