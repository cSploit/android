      <p>
            A <span class="emphasis"><em>nested transaction</em></span> is used to provide a
            transactional guarantee for a subset of operations performed within
            the scope of a larger transaction. Doing this allows you to commit
            and abort the subset of operations independently of the larger
            transaction. 
        </p>
      <p>
            The rules to the usage of a nested transaction are as follows:
        </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
                    While the nested (child) transaction is active, the parent
                    transaction may not perform any operations other than to commit
                    or abort, or to create more child transactions.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Committing a nested transaction has no effect on the state
                    of the parent transaction. The parent transaction is still
                    uncommitted. However, the parent transaction can now
                    see any modifications made by the child transaction.
                    Those modifications, of course, are still hidden to all
                    other transactions until the parent also commits.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Likewise, aborting the nested transaction has no effect on
                    the state of the parent transaction. The only result of the
                    abort is that neither the parent nor any
                    other transactions will see any of the
                    database modifications performed under the protection of the
                    nested transaction.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    If the parent transaction commits or aborts while it has
                    active children, the child transactions are resolved in the
                    same way as the parent. That is, if the parent aborts, then
                    the child transactions abort as well. If the parent commits,
                    then whatever modifications have been performed by the child
                    transactions are also committed. 
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    The locks held by a nested transaction are not released when
                    that transaction commits. Rather, they are now held by the
                    parent transaction until such a time as that parent commits.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Any database modifications performed by the nested transaction
                    are not visible outside of the larger encompassing
                    transaction until such a time as that parent transaction is
                    committed. 
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    The depth of the nesting that you can achieve with nested
                    transaction is limited only by memory.
                </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
            To create a nested transaction, simply pass the parent transaction's
            handle when you created the nested transaction's handle. For
            example:
        </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">    /* parent transaction */
    DB_TXN *parent_txn, *child_txn;
    ret = envp-&gt;txn_begin(envp, NULL, &amp;parent_txn, 0);
    /* child transaction */
    ret = envp-&gt;txn_begin(envp, parent_txn, &amp;child_txn, 0); </pre>
