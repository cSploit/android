            It is important to understand how locking works in a
            concurrent application before continuing with a description of
            the concurrency mechanisms DB makes available to you.
            Blocking and deadlocking have important performance implications
            for your application. Consequently, this section provides a
            fundamental description of these concepts, and how they affect
            DB operations.

                When one thread of control wants to obtain access to an
                object, it requests a <span class="emphasis"><em>lock</em></span> for that
                object. This lock is what allows DB to provide your
                application with its transactional isolation guarantees by
                ensuring that:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        no other thread of control can read that object (in
                        the case of an exclusive lock), and
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        no other thread of control can modify that object
                        (in the case of an exclusive or non-exclusive lock).
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">

          <p>
                When locking occurs, there are conceptually three resources
                in use:
                </p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p>
                        The locker.
                    </p>
                <p>
                        This is the thing that holds the lock. In a
                        transactional application, the locker is a
                        transaction handle. 
                       <span> 
                        For non-transactional operations, the locker is a cursor or a
                            
                            
                            <span>Database or Store</span>
                            
                        handle. 
                        </span>
                       
                    </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            The lock.        
                        </p>
                <p>
                            This is the actual data structure that locks
                            the object. In DB, a locked
                            object structure in the lock manager
                            is representative of the object that
                            is locked.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            The locked object.

                            The thing that your application
                            actually wants to lock.
                            In a DB
                            application, the locked object is usually a 
                            <span>
                                database page, which in turn contains
                                multiple database entries (key and data).
                                <span>
                                    However, for Queue databases,
                                    individual database records are locked. 
                                </span>

                    DB applications support both exclusive and
                    non-exclusive locks. <span class="emphasis"><em>Exclusive
                    locks</em></span> are granted when a
                    locker wants to write to an object. For this reason,
                    exclusive locks are also sometimes called
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>write locks</em></span>.
                </p>
          <p>
                    An exclusive lock prevents any other locker from
                    obtaining any sort of a lock on the object. This
                    provides isolation by ensuring that no other locker can
                    observe or modify an exclusively locked object until the locker is done
                    writing to that object.
                </p>
          <p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>Non-exclusive locks</em></span> are granted
                    for read-only access. For this reason, non-exclusive
                    locks are also sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>read
                    locks</em></span>. Since multiple lockers can
                    simultaneously hold read locks on the same
                    object, read locks are also
                    sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>shared locks</em></span>.
                </p>
          <p>
                    A non-exclusive lock prevents any other locker from
                    modifying the locked object while the locker is still
                    reading the object. This is how transactional cursors are able to
                    achieve repeatable reads; by default, the
                    cursor's transaction holds
                    a read lock on any object that the cursor has examined until
                    such a time as the transaction is committed
                    or aborted. 
                    <span>
                            You can avoid these read locks by using
                            snapshot isolation. See <a class="xref" href="isolation.html#snapshot_isolation" title="Using Snapshot Isolation">Using Snapshot Isolation</a>
                            for details.

                    A locker holds its locks until such a time as it does
                    not need the lock any more. What this means is:

                            A transaction holds any locks that it obtains
                            until the transaction is committed or aborted.

                            until such a time as the operation is completed. 
                            For cursor operations, the lock is held until the cursor is moved to a new position or
                            closed.
                        </p>

        <p>
                Simply put, a thread of control is blocked when it attempts
                to obtain a lock, but that attempt is denied because some
                other thread of control holds a conflicting lock.
                Once blocked, the thread of control is temporarily unable
                to make any forward progress until the requested lock is
                obtained or the operation requesting the lock is
                abandoned.
            </p>
        <p>
                Be aware that when we talk about blocking, strictly
                speaking the thread is not what is attempting to obtain the
                lock. Rather, some object within the thread (such as a
                cursor) is attempting to obtain the
                lock. However, once a locker attempts to
                obtain a lock, the entire thread of control must pause until the lock
                request is in some way resolved. 
            </p>
        <p>
                For example, if <code class="literal">Txn A</code> holds a write lock (an exclusive
                lock) on 
                            <span>object</span> 
                             
                002, then if <code class="literal">Txn B</code> tries to obtain a read <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> write lock on 
                that
                    <span>object,</span> 
                     
                        the thread of control in which <code class="literal">Txn
                        B</code> is running

                    However, if <code class="literal">Txn A</code> only holds a read

                        The previous description describes DB's default
                        behavior when it cannot obtain a lock. It is
                        possible to configure DB transactions so that
                        they will not block. Instead, if a lock is
                        unavailable, the application is immediately notified of a
                        deadlock situation. See <a class="xref" href="txnnowait.html" title="No Wait on Blocks">No Wait on Blocks</a>

                        applications typically perform better than simple
                        single-threaded applications because the
                        application can perform one part of its workload
                        (updating  
                            <span>a database record, </span>
                            
                         for example) while it is waiting for some other
                         lengthy operation to complete (performing disk or
                         network I/O, for example). This performance
                         improvement is particularly noticeable if you use
                         hardware that offers multiple CPUs, because the threads
                            <span>
                            and processes
                            </span>
                         can run simultaneously.

          <p>
                        That said, concurrent applications can see reduced
                        workload throughput if their threads of control are
                        seeing a large amount of lock contention. That is,
                        if threads are blocking on lock requests, then that
                        represents a performance penalty for your
                        application.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Consider once again the previous diagram of a blocked write lock request.
                        In that diagram, <code class="literal">Txn C</code> cannot
                        obtain its requested write lock because
                        <code class="literal">Txn A</code> and <code class="literal">Txn
                        B</code> are both already holding read locks on
                        the requested 
                            <span>object.</span> 
                             
                        In this case, the thread in which
                        <code class="literal">Txn C</code> is running will pause until
                        such a time as <code class="literal">Txn C</code> either
                        obtains its write lock, or the operation
                        that is requesting the lock is abandoned.
                        The fact that <code class="literal">Txn
                        C</code>'s thread has temporarily halted all
                        forward progress represents a performance penalty
                        for your application.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Moreover, any read locks that are requested while
                        <code class="literal">Txn C</code> is waiting for its write
                        lock will also block until such a time as 
                        <code class="literal">Txn C</code> has obtained and
                        subsequently released its write lock.

                        Reducing lock contention is an important part of
                        performance tuning your concurrent DB
                        application. Applications that have multiple
                        threads of control obtaining exclusive (write)
                        locks are prone to contention issues. Moreover, as
                        you increase the numbers of lockers and as you
                        increase the time that a lock is held, you increase
                        the chances of your application seeing lock contention.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        As you are designing your application, try to do
                        the following in order to reduce lock contention:
                    </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>
                                Reduce the length of time your application
                                holds locks.
                            </p>
                <p>
                                Shorter lived transactions will result in
                                shorter lock lifetimes, which will in turn
                                help to reduce lock contention. 
                            </p>
                <p>
                                In addition, by default transactional cursors hold read
                                locks until such a time as the transaction is completed.
                                For this reason, try to minimize the time you keep
                                transactional cursors opened, or reduce your isolation
                                levels – see below.
                            </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                                If possible, access heavily accessed (read
                                or write) items toward the end of the
                                transaction. This reduces the amount of
                                time that a heavily used 
                                    <span>
                                        page
                                    </span>
                                    
                                is locked by the transaction.
                            </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                                Reduce your application's isolation guarantees.
                            </p>
                <p>
                                By reducing your isolation guarantees, you
                                reduce the situations in which a lock can
                                block another lock. Try using uncommitted reads
                                for your read operations in order to
                                prevent a read lock being blocked by a
                                write lock. 
                             </p>
                <p>
                                In addition, for cursors you can use degree
                                2 (read committed) isolation, which causes
                                the cursor to release its read locks as
                                soon as it is done reading the record (as
                                opposed to holding its read locks until the
                                transaction ends).
                             </p>
                <p>
                                Be aware that reducing your
                                isolation guarantees can have
                                adverse consequences for your
                                application. Before deciding
                                to reduce your isolation, take
                                care to examine your
                                application's isolation
                                requirements.

                <p>
                                        Snapshot isolation causes the
                                        transaction to make a copy of the
                                        page on which it is holding a lock.
                                        When a reader makes a copy of a
                                        page, write locks can still be
                                        obtained for the original page.
                                        This eliminates entirely read-write
                                        contention.

                                Depending on the nature of your application,
                                this may be something that you can not
                                do anything about. However, if it is
                                possible to create your threads such that
                                they operate only on non-overlapping
                                portions of your database, then you can
                                reduce lock contention because your
                                threads will rarely (if ever) block on one another's
                                locks.

                        It is possible to configure DB's transactions
                        so that they never wait on blocked lock requests.
                        Instead, if they are blocked on a lock request,
                        they will notify the application of a deadlock (see
                        the next section).
                        </p>
            <p>
                            You configure this behavior on a transaction by
                            transaction basis. See <a class="xref" href="txnnowait.html" title="No Wait on Blocks">No Wait on Blocks</a> for more information.

                A deadlock occurs when two or more threads of control are
                blocked, each waiting on a resource held by the other
                thread. When this happens, there is no
                possibility of the threads ever making forward progress
                unless some outside agent takes action to break the
                deadlock.
            </p>
        <p>
                For example, if
                <code class="literal">Txn A</code> is
                blocked by <code class="literal">Txn B</code> at the same time
                <code class="literal">Txn B</code> is blocked by <code class="literal">Txn
                A</code> then the threads of control containing
                <code class="literal">Txn A</code> and <code class="literal">Txn B</code> are
                deadlocked; neither thread can make
                any forward progress because neither thread will ever release the lock
                that is blocking the other thread.

        <p>
                When two threads of control deadlock, the only
                solution is to have a mechanism external to the two threads
                capable of recognizing the deadlock and notifying at least
                one thread that it is in a deadlock situation.
                Once notified, a thread of
                control must abandon the attempted operation in order to
                resolve the deadlock.

                <span>
                DB's locking subsystem offers a deadlock notification
                mechanism.  See

                Note that when one locker in a thread of control is blocked

                    The things that you do to avoid lock contention also
                    help to reduce deadlocks (see <a class="xref" href="blocking_deadlocks.html#blockavoidance" title="Avoiding Blocks">Avoiding Blocks</a>).

                    <span>
                    Beyond that, you can also do the following in order to
                    avoid deadlocks:

                            Never have more than one active transaction at
                            a time in a thread. A common cause of this is
                            for a thread to be using auto-commit for one
                            operation while an explicit transaction is in
                            use in that thread at the same time.

                <p>
                            Make sure all threads access data in the same
                            order as all other threads. So long as threads
                            lock database pages
                            in the same basic order, there is no
                            possibility of a deadlock (threads can still
                            block, however).

                            Be aware that if you are using secondary
                            databases (indexes), it is not possible to
                            obtain locks in a consistent order because you
                            cannot predict the order in which locks are
                            obtained in secondary databases. If you are
                            writing a concurrent application and you are
                            using secondary databases, you must be prepared
                            to handle deadlocks.

                            If you are using BTrees in which you are
                            constantly adding and then deleting data, turn
                            Btree reverse split off. See

                            Declare a read/modify/write lock for those
                            situations where you are reading a record in
                            preparation of modifying and then writing the
                            record. Doing this causes DB to give your
                            read operation a write lock. This means that no
                            other thread of control can share a read lock
                            (which might cause contention), but it also
                            means that the writer thread will not have to
                            wait to obtain a write lock when it is ready to
                            write the modified data back to the database.
