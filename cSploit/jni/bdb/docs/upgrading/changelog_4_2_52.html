            <li>Add support for a reduced memory footprint build of the Berkeley DB library. [#1967]</li>
            <li>Add the DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;set_flags interface which disallows the creation of backing filesystem files for in-memory databases. [#4224]</li>
            <li>Add cache interfaces to limit the number of buffers written sequentially to allow applications to bound the time they will monopolize the disk. [#4935]</li>
            <li>Support auto-deletion of log files. [#0040] [#6252]</li>
            <li>The new Java DBX API for Berkeley DB allows Java programmers to use a familiar Java Collections style API, including Map, while interacting with the transactional Berkeley DB core engine. [#6260]</li>
            <li>Support auto-commit with the DB-&gt;get method's consume operations.  [#6954]</li>
            <li>Add "get" methods to retrieve most settings. [#7061]</li>
            <li>Add Javadoc documentation to the Berkeley DB release. [#7110]</li>
            <li>Add support to Concurrent Data Store to allow duplication of write cursors. [#7167]</li>
            <li>Add C++ utility classes for iterating over multiple key and data items returned from a cursor when using the DB_MULTIPLE or DB_MULTIPLE_KEY flags. [#7351]</li>
            <li>Add CamelCased methods to the Java API. [#7396]</li>
            <li>Add the DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;set_maxsize interface to enforce a maximum database size. [#7582]</li>
            <li>Add a toString() method for all Java *Stat classes (DbBtreeStat, DbHashStat, DbMpoolStat, etc.). This method creates a listing of values of all of the class member variables. [#7712]</li>

            <li>Fix a bug which could cause database environment open to hang, in database environments supporting cryptography. [#6621]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where a database environment panic might result from an out-of-disk-space error while rolling back a page allocation. [#6694]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where a database page write failure, in a database environment configured for encryption or byte-swapping, could cause page corruption. [#6791]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where DB-&gt;truncate could drop core if there were active cursors in the database. [#6846]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where for databases sharing a physical file required a file descriptor per database. [#6981]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where the panic callback routine was only being called in the first thread of control to detect the error when returning DB_RUNRECOVERY. [#7019]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where a transaction which contained a remove of a subdatabase and an allocation to another subdatabase in the same file might not properly be aborted. [#7356]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug to now disallow DB_TRUNCATE on opens in locking environments, since we cannot prevent race conditions. In the absence of locking and transactions, DB_TRUNCATE will truncate ANY file for which the user has appropriate permissions. [#7345]</li>
            <li>Fix several bugs around concurrent creation of databases. [#7363]</li>
            <li>Change methods in DbEnv that provide access to statistics information so that they now return instances of the proper classes.  [#7395]</li>
            <li>Replace the DB-&gt;set_cache_priority API with the DB_MPOOLFILE-&gt;set_priority API. [#7545]</li>

            <li>Allow creating into a file that was renamed within the same transaction. [#7581]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where DB_ENV-&gt;txn_stat could drop core if there are more-than-expected active transactions. [#7638]</li>
            <li>Change Berkeley DB to ignore user-specified byte orders when creating a database in an already existing physical file. [#7640]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where a database rename that is aborted would leak some memory. [#7789]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where files could not be renamed or removed if they were not writable. [#7819]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where an error during a database open may leak memory in the mpool region. [#7834]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where the DB_ENV-&gt;trickle_sync method could flush all of the dirty buffers in the cache rather than a subset. [#7863]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where an attempt to rename or remove an open file in the same transaction could succeed, even though this is not allowed and will not work on Windows. [#7917]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where if a recovery interval in the log contained only database opens then a recovery might report "Improper file close".  [#7886]</li>
            <li>Add a flag, DB_INIT_REP to DB_ENV-&gt;open to initialize Replication subsystem. [#8299]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where file remove and rename operations would not block each other if they were in different transactions. [#8340]</li>
            <li>Change Berkeley DB to not propagate error returns from the application's rep_send function out of the Berkeley DB API. [#8496] [#8522]</li>
            <li>Remove restriction that DB_TRUNCATE is not allowed on files with subdatabases. This restriction was introduced in 4.1.25. [#8852]</li>

            <li>Prohibit the use of the DB_RMW flag on get operations for DB handles opened in transactional mode. [#7407]</li>
            <li>Standardize when Berkeley DB will return DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED, or throw DbLockNotGrantedException, versus returning DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK or throwing DbDeadlockException. Fix bugs in the C++ and Java APIs where DbException was thrown, encapsulating DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED, rather than throwing DbLockNotGrantedException. [#7549]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where Berkeley DB could hang on a race condition if a checkpoint was running at the same time another thread was closing a database for the last time. [#7604]</li>
            <li>Fix several bugs that made multiple filesystem level operations inside a single transaction break. [#7728]</li>

            <li>Fix a bug where the duplicate data item count could be incorrect if a cursor was used to first overwrite and then delete a duplicate which was part of a set of duplicates large enough to have been stored outside the standard access method pages.  [#8445]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where The DB_MULTIPLE interface might fail to return the proper duplicates in some edge cases. [#8485]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where DB-&gt;get(...DB_MULTIPLE) would not return a reasonable estimate of the buffer size required to return a set of duplicates.  [#8513]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where the DbCursor.count method could return the wrong count in the case of small (on-page) duplicate sets, where a still-open cursor has been used to delete one of the duplicate data items. [#8851]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where a non-transactional cursor using DB_MULTIPLE_KEY could briefly be left pointing at an unlocked page. This could lead to a race condition with another thread deleting records resulting in the wrong record being deleted. [#8926]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where a key/data item could be lost if a cursor is used to do a delete, and then immediately used to do an insert which causes a set of duplicates to be shifted to an off-page Btree. [#9085]</li>
