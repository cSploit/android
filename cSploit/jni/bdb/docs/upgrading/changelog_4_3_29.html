            <li>Fix a bug where the permissions on system shared memory segments did
	not match the mode specified in the DB_ENV-&gt;open() method.  [#8921]</li>
            <li>Add a new return error from the DB_ENV-&gt;open() method call,
DB_VERSION_MISMATCH, which is returned in the case of an application
compiled under one version of Berkeley DB attempting to open an
environment created under a different version.  [#9077]</li>
            <li>Add support for importing databases from a transactional database
	environment into a different environment. [#9324]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where a core dump could occur if a zero-length database
	environment name was specified. [#9233]</li>
            <li>Increase the number of environment regions to 100. [#9297]</li>
            <li>Remove the DB_ENV-&gt;set_verbose() method flag DB_VERB_CHKPOINT.
	[#9405]</li>
            <li>Fix bugs where database environment getters could return incorrect
information after the database environment was opened, if a different
thread of control changed the database environment values.  Fix bugs
where database environment getter/setter functions could race with other
threads of control. [#9724]</li>
            <li>Change the DbEnv.set_lk_detect method to match the DbEnv.open
semantics. That is, DbEnv.set_lk_detect may be called after the database
environment is opened, allowing applications to configure automatic
deadlock detection if it has not yet been configured. [#9724]</li>
            <li>Fix cursor locks for environments opened without DB_THREAD so that
they use the same locker ID. This eliminates many common cases of
application self-deadlock, particularly in CDS.  [#9742]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug in DB-&gt;get_env() in the C API where it could return an
error when it should only return the DB_ENV handle.  C++ and Java are
unchanged. [#9828]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where we only need to initialize the cryptographic memory
	region when MPOOL, Log or Transactions have been configured.  [#9872]</li>
            <li>Change private database environments at process startup to only
allocate the heap memory required at any particular time, rather than
always allocating the maximum amount of heap memory configured for the
environment.  [#9889]</li>
            <li>Add a method to create nonexistent intermediate directories when
	opening database files. [#9898]</li>
            <li>Add support for in-memory logging within database environments.
	[#9927]</li>
            <li>Change Berkeley DB so configuring a database environment for
automatic log file removal affects all threads in the environment, not
just the DbEnv handle in which the configuration call is made.  [#9947]</li>
            <li>Change the signature of the error callback passed to the
DB_ENV-&gt;set_errcall and DB-&gt;set_errcall methods to add a DB_ENV handle,
to provide database environment context for the callback function.
[#10025]</li>
            <li>Fix a race condition between DB-&gt;close and DB-&gt;{remove,rename} on
filesystems that don't allow file operations on open files (such as
Windows).  [#10180]</li>
            <li>Add a DB_DSYNC_LOG flag to the DbEnv::set_flags method, which
configures O_DSYNC on POSIX systems and FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH on Win32
systems.  This offers significantly better performance for some
applications on certain Solaris/filesystem combinations.  [#10205]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where calling the DB or DBEnv database remove or rename
methods could cause a transaction checkpoint or cache flush to fail.
[#10286]</li>
            <li>Change file operations not to flush a file if it hasn't been written.
	[#10537]</li>
            <li>Remove 4GB restriction on region sizes on 64 bit machines. [#10668]</li>
            <li>Simplify the signature of substitute system calls for ftruncate and
	seek. [#10668]</li>
            <li>Change Berkeley DB so that opening an environment without specifying
a home directory will cause the DB_CONFIG file in the current directory
to be read, if it exists. [#11424]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug that caused a core dump if DB handles without associated
	database environments were used for database verification. [#11649]</li>
            <li>Fix Windows mutexes shared between processes run as different users.
	[#11985]</li>
            <li>Fix Windows mutexes for some SMP machines. [#12417]</li>

new error indicates that the supplied DBT is too small. ENOMEM is now
always fatal.  [#9314]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug when an update through a secondary index is deadlocked it

decreasing the size of a file and the last page of the file is freed,
it will be returned to the operating system.  [#9620]</li>
            <li>Fix a bug where DB_RUNRECOVERY could be returned if there was no
more disk space while aborting the allocation of a new page in a
database.  [#9643]</li>
