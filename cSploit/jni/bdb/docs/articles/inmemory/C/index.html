                This document describes how to write a DB application
                that keeps its data entirely in memory. That is, the
                application writes no data to disk. For this reason,
                in-memory only applications typically discard all 
                data durability guarantees.

          <p>
                        This document assume familiarity with the
                        <em class="citetitle">Getting Started with Berkeley DB</em> guide. If
                        you are using environments or transactions, then
                        you should also have an understanding of the
                        concepts in <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Getting Started with Transaction Processing</em>
                        guide.
                </p>
        </div>
        <p>
                There are several reasons why you might want to write an
                in-memory only DB application. For platforms on which a
                disk drive is available to back your data, an in-memory
                application might be desirable from a performance
                perspective. In this case, the data that your application
                manages might be generated during run-time and so is of no
                interest across application startups.
        </p>
        <p>
                Other platforms are disk-less. In this case, an in-memory only
                configuration is the only possible choice. Note that this
                document's primary focus is disk-less systems for which an
                on-disk filesystem is not available.

                        Before continuing, it is worthwhile to briefly
                        describe the DB resources that must be managed
                        if you are going to configure an in-memory only
                        DB application. These are resources that are by
                        default persisted on disk, or backed by a
                        filesystem on disk. Some configuration is therefore
                        required to keep these resources in-memory only.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Note that you can configure only some of these
                        resources to be held in-memory, and allow others to
                        be backed by disk. This might be desireable for
                        some applications that wish to improve application
                        performance by, for example, eliminating disk I/O
                        for some, but not all, of these resources. However,
                        for the purpose of this document, we assume you
                        want to configure all of these resources to be held
                        in memory.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Managing these resources for an in-memory
                        application is described in detail later in this
                        article.

              <p>
                                        Normally, DB stores your
                                        database data within on-disk files.
                                        For an entirely in-memory
                                        application, you are required to turn
                                        off this behavior.

                                        files for a variety of purposes.
                                        Normally these are backed by the
                                        filesystem, but by using the
                                        appropriate configuration option
                                        you can cause region files to
                                        reside in memory only.

              <p>
                                        The DB cache must be configured
                                        large enough to hold all your data
                                        in memory. If you do not size your
                                        cache large enough, then DB
                                        will attempt to write pages to
                                        disk. In a disk-less system, this
                                        will result in an abnormal
                                        termination of your program.

              <p>
                                        DB logs describe the write activity
                                        that has occurred in your application.
                                        They are used for a number of purposes,
                                        such as recovery operations for
                                        applications that are seeking data
                                        durability guarantees.
                                </p>
              <p>
                                        For in-memory applications that do not
                                        care about durability guarantees, logs
                                        are still required if you want
                                        transactional benefits other than
                                        durability (such as isolation
                                        and atomicity). This is because DB's
                                        transactional subsystem requires logs,
                                        even if you want to discard all data
                                        durability guarantees.
                                </p>
              <p>
                                        If this describes your application, you
                                        must enable logs but configure them to
                                        reside only within memory.
                                </p>

              <p>
                                        You must disallow backing temporary
                                        database files with the
                                        filesystem. This is mostly a
                                        configuration option, but it is
                                        also dependent upon sizing your
                                        cache correctly.
                                </p>

        <p>
                    In addition to these, if you are writing a replicated application (see
                    <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Getting Started with Replicated Applications</em> for an introduction to writing replicated
                    applications), there is internal replication information that is normally kept
                    on-disk.  You can cause this information to be kept in-memory if you are
                    willing to accept some limitations in how your replicated application operates.
                    See <a class="xref" href="index.html#in-mem-rep" title="In-Memory Replicated Applications">In-Memory Replicated Applications</a> for more information.

                        DB is an extremely flexible product that can be
                        adapted to suit almost any data management
                        requirements. This means that you can configure
                        DB to operate entirely within memory, but still
                        retain some data durability guarantees or even
                        throw away all durability guarantees.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Data durability guarantees describe how persistent
                        your data is. That is, once you have made a change
                        to the data stored in your database, how much of a
                        guarantee do you require that that modification
                        will persist (not be lost)? There are a great many
                        options here. For the absolute best durability guarantee, you
                        should fully transaction-protect your data and
                        allow your data to be written to disk upon each
                        transaction commit. Of course, this guarantee is
                        not available for disk-less systems.
                </p>
        <p>
                        At the opposite end of the spectrum, you can throw
                        away all your data once your application is done
                        with it (for example, at application shutdown).
                        This is a good option if you are using DB only
                        as a kind of caching mechanism. In this case, you
                        obviously must either generate your data entirely
                        during runtime, or obtain it from some remote
                        location during application startup.
                </p>
        <p>
                        There are also durability options that exist somewhere in
                        between these two extremes. For example, disk-less
                        systems are sometimes backed by some kind of flash
                        memory (e.g. compact flash cards). These
                        platforms may want to limit the number of writes 
                        applied to the backing media because it is capable 
                        of accepting only a limited number of writes before it must
                        be replaced.  For this reason, you might want to 
                        limit data writes to the flash media only during
                        specific moments during your application's
                        runtime; for example, only at application shutdown.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Another way to improve data durability
                        for in-memory configurations is to use
                        DB replication to commit data to the network.
                        This strategy takes advantage of the fact that
                        running clients have in-memory copies of the data
                        and can take over in the event of an outage at the
                        master. The use of replication in this way
                        increases durability for your data while providing
                        the benefit of avoiding disk I/O on transaction
                        commit.
                </p>

                    In-memory replicated applications are described in more

        <p>
                        The point here is to be aware that a great many
                        options are available to you when writing an
                        in-memory only application. That said, the focus of
                        this document is strictly disk-less systems; that
                        is, systems that provide no means by which 
                        data can be written to persistent media.

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                        Normally DB databases are backed by the
                        filesystem. For in-memory applications, such as
                        is required on disk-less systems, you can cause your
                        database to only reside in-memory. That is,
                        their contents are stored entirely within DB's
                        cache.
                </p>
        <p>
                        There are two requirements for keeping your
                        database(s) in-memory.
                        The first is to size your cache such that it is big
                        enough to hold all your data in-memory. If your
                        cache fills up, then DB will return
                        <code class="literal">ENOMEM</code> on the next operation
                        that requests additional pages in the cache. As with all errors while
                        updating a database, the current transaction must be aborted. If the update
                        was being done without a transaction, then the application must close its
                        environment and database handles, reopen them, and then refresh the database
                        from some backup data source.
                </p>
        <p>
                        For information on setting the cache size, see
                        <a class="xref" href="index.html#cachesize" title="Sizing the Cache">Sizing the Cache</a>.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Beyond cache sizing, you also must tell DB not
                        to back your database with an on-disk file. You do
                        this by NOT providing a database file name
                        when you open the database. Note that the database
                        file name is different from the database name; you
                        can name your in-memory databases even if you
                        are not storing them in an on-disk file.
                </p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                        Like databases, DB environments are usually backed by the filesystem. In
                        fact, a big part of what environments do is identify the location on disk
                        where resources (such as log and database files) are kept.
                </p>
        <p>
                        However, environments are also used for managing resources, such as
                        obtaining new transactions, so they are useful even when building an
                        in-memory application. Therefore, if you are going to use an environment for
                        your in-memory DB application, you must configure it such that it does
                        not want to use the filesystem. There are two things you need to do here.
                </p>
        <p>
                        First, when you open your environment, do NOT identify a home directory. To
                        accomplish this, you must:
                </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                                        NOT provide a value for the <code class="literal">db_home</code>
                                        parameter on the
                                        <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</code>
                                        method.
                                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                                        NOT have a DB_HOME environment variable set.
                                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                                        NOT call any of the methods that affect file naming
                                        (<code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;add_data_dir()</code>,
                                        <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lg_dir()</code>, or
                                        <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;set_tmp_dir()</code>).
                                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                        Beyond this, you must also ensure that regions are backed by heap memory
                        instead of by the filesystem or system shared memory. You do this when you
                        open your environment by specifying the <code class="literal">DB_PRIVATE</code> flag.
                        Note that the use of <code class="literal">DB_PRIVATE</code> means that you can only
                        have one open handle for your environment at a time.  Consequently, your
                        in-memory only application must be single-process, although it can be
                        multi-threaded.
                </p>
        <p>

                        One of the most important considerations for an
                        in-memory application is to ensure that your
                        database cache is large enough. In a normal
                        application that is not in-memory, the cache
                        provides a mechanism by which frequently-used
                        data can be accessed without resorting to disk I/O.
                        For an in-memory application, the cache is the only
                        location your data can exist so it is critical that
                        you make the cache large enough for your data set.
                </p>
        <p>
                        You specify the size of your cache at application
                        startup. Obviously you should not specify a size
                        that is larger than available memory. Note that the
                        size you specify for your cache is actually a
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>maximum</em></span> size; DB will only 
                        use memory as required so if you specify a cache
                        size of 1 GB but your data set is only ever 10 MB
                        in size, then 10 MB is what DB will use.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Note that if you specify a cache size less than
                        500 MB, then the cache size is automatically
                        increased by 25% to account for internal overhead
                        purposes.
                </p>
        <p>
                        There are two ways to specify a cache size,
                        depending on whether you are using a database
                        environment.

        <p>
                        Normally, when a database is opened, a temporary
                        file is opened on-disk to back the database. This
                        file is used if the database grows so large that it
                        fills the entire cache. At that time, database
                        pages that do not fit into the in-memory cache file
                        are written temporarily to this file.
                </p>
        <p>
                        For disk-less systems, you should configure your
                        databases so that this temporary file is not
                        created. When you do this, any attempt to create
                        new database pages once the cache is full will
                        fail.
                </p>
        <p>
                        You configure this option on a per-database handle
                        basis. That means you must configure this for every
                        in-memory database that your application uses.
                </p>
        <p>
                        To set this option, obtain the
                        <code class="literal">DB_MPOOLFILE</code> field from you
                        <code class="literal">DB</code> and then configure
                        <code class="literal">DB_MPOOL_NOFILE</code> using the

        <p>
                    DB logs describe the write activity that has occurred in
                    your application. For a purely in-memory application, logs
                    should be used only if you wish to transaction-protect your
                    database writes as logs are required by the DB
                    transactional subsystem.
                 </p>
        <p>
                    Note that transactions provide a number of guarantees. One
                    of these is not interesting to a purely in-memory
                    application (data durability). However, other transaction
                    guarantees such as isolation and atomicity might be of
                    interest to your application.
                 </p>
        <p>
                        If this is the case for your application, then you must
                        configure your logs to be kept entirely in-memory. You
                        do this by setting a configuration option that prevents
                        DB from writing log data to disk.
                        Do this by setting the <code class="literal">DB_LOG_IN_MEMORY</code> flag using the
                        <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;log_set_config()</code> method.
                </p>
        <p>
                        In addition, you must configure your log buffer size so that it is capable
                        of holding all log information that can accumulate during your longest
                        running transaction. That is, make sure the in-memory log buffer is large
                        enough that no transaction will ever span the entire buffer. Also, avoid a
                        state where the in-memory buffer is full and no space can be freed because a
                        transaction that started the first log "file" is still active.
                </p>
        <p>
                        How much log buffer space is required is a function of the number of
                        transactions you have running concurrently, how long they last, and how much
                        write activity occurs within them. When in-memory logging is configured, the
                        default log buffer space is 1 MB. 
                </p>
        <p>
                        You set your log buffer space using the
                        <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;set_lg_bsize()</code>.
                </p>
        <p>
                        For example, the following code fragment configure in-memory log usage, and
                        it configures the log buffer size to 10 MB:

                If you are unfamiliar with writing DB replicated
                applications, or if you are simply uninterested in this
                topic, you can skip this section.  For an introductory
                description of DB replication, please see the
                <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Getting Started with Replicated Applications</em> guide.
            </p>
        <p>
                In-memory replicated applications can improve transaction
                throughput by avoiding disk I/O. Network connections are
                often faster than local synchronous disk writes, so
                in-memory replicated applications can provide significantly
                improved performance without entirely sacrificing
                reliability.
            </p>
        <p>
                All of your replication participants must be configured in
                the same way. That is, they all must be configured for
                in-memory storage of data, or they must all be configured
                for on-disk storage of data.  As a result, in-memory
                replicated applications can achieve improved throughput
                performance, but they do so at the cost of reduced
                durability guarantees.  This is because the transaction
                commit is not backed by stable storage anywhere in the
                replication group. However, this "commit to the network"
                does not sacrifice all durability. Because running clients
                should have in-memory copies of the data, a client can take
                over in the event of an outage at the master and in this way
                avoid the loss of data.
            </p>
        <p>
                There are many internal resources used by the DB
                replication subsystem which are by default backed by disk.
                These internal resources help the DB subsystem ensure
                election accuracy. While a complete description of these
                resources is beyond the scope of this article, you should
                know that you can cause all of these resources to be held
                entirely in-memory.  But you do so with some small chance
                of operational errors in your replicated application.
            </p>
        <p>
                If you cause a replicated application to keep its internal
                replication resources in-memory, you run a small risk that
                elections will fail or be unable to complete.  However,
                calling additional elections should eventually yield a
                winner.
            </p>
        <p>
                In addition, there is a slight possibility that the wrong
                site might win an election, which could result in the loss
                of data. This can happen if you have a site that is
                repeatedly crashing and trying to come back up. A site like
                this  might be repeatedly sending out election information,
                and the repeated messages might confuse other sites.  For
                replication applications that are not in-memory, these
                extra messages would be ignored by other sites because they
                would also contain some state information that allows other
                sites to know which election messages are relevant.  But
                strictly in-memory replicated applications cannot maintain
                this state information, and so some other sites might
                become confused. The result might be that the wrong site
                could be elected master due to the inconsistent information
                that is available to them.

          <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
          <p>
                    This is very much a corner case that you probably will
                    never see in your production systems, especially if
                    your sites are all stable and well-behaved.
                </p>
        </div>
        <p>
                If an election is won by the wrong site (site A), then some
                other site (site B) probably has more recent log files than
                the winner does. But since the wrong site A won the
                election, site B will sync with the new master. This will
                cause site B (and therefore, your entire replication group)
                to lose any log files it contains that are more recent than
                the files contained by site A.
            </p>
        <p>
                If you are running a master that is configured to run with
                internal replication resources in-memory, you should never
                allow that site to appoint itself master again immediately
                after crashing or rebooting.  Doing so results in a
                slightly higher risk of your client sites crashing. To
                determine your next master, you should either hold an
                election or appoint a different site to be master.
            </p>
        <p>
                In order to cause a replication site to run entirely
                in-memory, do all of the things described previously in
                this document to place all other DB resources
                in-memory.  Then, when configuring replication, specify
                <code class="literal">DB_REP_CONF_INMEM</code> to the
                <code class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_config()</code>
                method.

                        The following brief example illustrates how to open
                        an application that is entirely in-memory. The
                        application opens an environment and a single
                        database, and does this in a way that the database
                        is transaction-protected.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Transactions can be
                        desirable for an in-memory application even though
                        you discard your durability guarantees, because of
                        the other things that transactions offer such as
                        atomicity and isolation.
                </p>
        <p>
                        Notice that the example does nothing other than
                        open and close the environment and database. DB
                        database reads and writes work identically between
                        in-memory-only and durable applications (that is,
                        applications that write database application to
                        durable storage). Consequently, there is no point
                        in illustrating those actions here.
