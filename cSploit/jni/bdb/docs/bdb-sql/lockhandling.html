      <p>
            There is a difference in how applications written for the
            BDB SQL interface handle deadlocks as opposed to how deadlocks are handled
            for SQLite applications. For the SQLite developer, the
            following information is a necessary review in order to
            understand how the BDB SQL interface behaves differently.
        </p>
      <p>
            From a usage point of view, the BDB SQL interface behaves in the same way
            as SQLite in shared cache mode. The implications of this
            are explained below.

                As mentioned previously in this chapter, SQLite locks the
                entire database while performing a transaction. It also has a
                locking model that is different from the BDB SQL interface, one that
                supports multiple readers, but only a single writer. In SQLite,
                transactions can start as follows:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">BEGIN</code>
                    </p>
              <p>
                        Begins the transaction, locking the entire database for
                        reading. Use this if you only want to read from the
                        database.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">BEGIN IMMEDIATE</code>
                    </p>
              <p>
                        Begins the transaction, acquiring a "modify" lock. This
                        is also known as a RESERVED lock. Use this if you are
                        modifying the database (that is, performing
                        <code class="literal">INSERT</code>, <code class="literal">UPDATE</code>,
                        or <code class="literal">DELETE</code>). RESERVED locks and read
                        locks can co-exist.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        <code class="literal">BEGIN EXCLUSIVE</code>
                    </p>
              <p>
                        Begins the transaction, acquiring a write lock.
                        Transactions begun this way will be written to the disk
                        upon commit. No other lock can co-exist with an
                        exclusive lock.
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
                The last two statements are a kind of a contract. If you can
                get them to complete (that is, not return
                <code class="literal">SQLITE_LOCKED</code>), then you can start modifying
                the database (that is, change data in the in-memory cache), and
                you will eventually be able to commit (write) your
                modifications to the database.
            </p>
        <p>
                In order to avoid deadlocks in SQLite, programmers who want
                to modify a SQLite database start the transaction with
                <code class="literal">BEGIN IMMEDIATE</code>.  If the transaction cannot
                acquire the necessary locks, it will fail, returning 
                <code class="literal">SQLITE_BUSY</code>. At that point, the transaction
                falls back to an unlocked state whereby it holds no locks
                against the database. This means that any existing transactions in a
                RESERVED state can safely wait for the necessary EXCLUSIVE lock
                in order to finally write their modifications from the
                in-memory cache to the on-disk database.
            </p>
        <p>
                The important point here is that so long as the programmer uses
                these locks correctly, he can assume that he can proceed with
                his work without encountering a deadlock. (Assuming that all
                database readers and writers are also using these locks
                correctly.)
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">

            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="bdblockusage"></a>Lock Usage with the BDB SQL Interface</h3>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
                When you use the BDB SQL interface, you can 
                begin your transaction with <code class="literal">BEGIN</code> or <code class="literal">BEGIN EXCLUSIVE</code>.
                </p>
        <p>
                Note that the <code class="literal">IMMEDIATE</code> keyword is ignored in the BDB SQL interface (<code class="literal">BEGIN IMMEDIATE</code> behaves like <code class="literal">BEGIN</code>).
            </p>
        <p>
                When you begin your transaction with <code class="literal">BEGIN</code>, Berkeley DB decides what kind of a lock
                you need based on what you are doing to the database. If
                you perform an action that is read-only, it acquires a read
                lock. If you perform a write action, it acquires a write
                lock.
            </p>
        <p>    
                Also, the BDB SQL interface supports multiple readers
                <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> multiple writers. This means that
                multiple transactions can acquire locks
                as long as they are not trying to modify the
                same page.  For example:
            </p>
        <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>Session 1:</strong></span>
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">dbsql&gt; create table a(x int);
dbsql&gt; begin;
dbsql&gt; insert into a values (1);
dbsql&gt; commit; </pre>
        <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>Session 2:</strong></span>
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">dbsql&gt; create table b(x int);
dbsql&gt; begin;
dbsql&gt; insert into b values (1);
dbsql&gt; commit; </pre>
        <p>
                Because these two sessions are operating on different pages
                in the Berkeley DB cache, this example will work. If you tried
                this with SQLite, you could not start the second
                transaction until the first had completed.
            </p>
        <p>
                However, if you do this using the BDB SQL interface:
            </p>
        <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>Session 1:</strong></span>
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">dbsql&gt; begin;
dbsql&gt; insert into a values (2);</pre>
        <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>Session 2:</strong></span>
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">dbsql&gt; begin;
dbsql&gt; insert into a values (2); </pre>
        <p>
                The second session blocks until the first session commits
                the transaction. Again, this is because both sessions are
                operating on the same database page(s). However, if you
                simultaneously attempt to write pages in reverse order, you
                can deadlock. For example:
            </p>
        <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>Session 1:</strong></span>
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">dbsql&gt; begin;
dbsql&gt; insert into a values (3);
dbsql&gt; insert into b values (3);
</pre>
        <p>
                <span class="bold"><strong>Session 2:</strong></span>
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">dbsql&gt; begin;
dbsql&gt; insert into b values (3);
dbsql&gt; insert into a values (3);
Error: database table is locked
</pre>
        <p>
                What happens here is that Session 1 is blocked waiting
                for a lock on table b, while Session 2 is blocked
                waiting for a lock on table a. The application can make
                no forward progress, and so it is deadlocked.
            </p>
        <p>
                When such a deadlock is detected one session loses the lock it got 
                when executing its last statement, and that statement is automatically rolled back.
                The rest of the statements in the session will still be valid, and you can 
                continue to execute statements in that session. 
                The session that does not lose its lock to deadlock detection 
                will continue to execute as if nothing happened. 
                </p>
        <p>
                Assume Session 2 was sacrificed to deadlock detection, no value would be inserted into a and an error will be returned.
                But the insertion of value 3 into b would still be valid.  
                Session 1 would continue to wait while inserting into table b 
                until Session 2 either commits or aborts, thus freeing the lock it has on table b.
                </p>
        <p>
            When you begin your transaction with <code class="literal">BEGIN EXCLUSIVE</code>, the session is 
            never aborted due to deadlock or lock contention with another transaction.
            Non-exclusive transactions are allowed to execute concurrently with the exclusive
			transaction, but the non-exclusive transactions will have their locks
			released if deadlock with the exclusive transaction occurs. If two or 
            more exclusive transactions are running at the same time, they 
            will be forced to execute in serial.
            </p>
        <p>If Session 1 was using an exclusive transaction, 
            then Session 2 would lose its locks when deadlock is detected between the two.  
            If both Session 1 and Session 2 start an exclusive transaction, then the 
            last one to start the exclusive transaction would be blocked after 
            executing <code class="literal">BEGIN EXCLUSIVE</code> until the first one is committed or aborted.
