      <p>There are several arguments you can specify when configuring Berkeley DB.
Although only the Berkeley DB-specific ones are described here, most of the
standard GNU autoconf arguments are available and supported.  To see a
complete list of possible arguments, specify the --help flag to the
configure program.</p>
      <p>The Berkeley DB specific arguments are as follows:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p><a id="build_unix_conf.--disable-largefile"></a>
            <span class="bold"><strong>--disable-largefile</strong></span>
        </p>
            <p>
            Some systems, notably versions of Solaris, require
            special compile-time options in order to create files larger
            than 2^32 bytes.  These options are automatically enabled when
            Berkeley DB is compiled.  For this reason, binaries built on
            current versions of these systems may not run on earlier
            versions of the system because the library and system calls
            necessary for large files are not available.  To disable
            building with these compile-time options, enter
            --disable-largefile as an argument to configure.
        </p>
          </li>

        </p>
            <p>
            On systems supporting shared libraries, Berkeley DB builds both
            static and shared libraries by default.  (Shared libraries are
            built using 
            <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html" target="_top">
            the GNU Project's Libtool</a> distribution, which supports
            shared library builds on many (although not all) systems.)  To
            not build shared libraries, configure using the
            --disable-shared argument.  To not build static libraries,
            configure using the --disable-static argument.

            release of the Berkeley DB library, enter --enable-compat185 as
            an argument to configure.  This will include Berkeley DB 1.85
            API compatibility code in the library.

            as a compiler flag and with <span class="bold"><strong>DEBUG</strong></span> #defined during compilation,
            enter --enable-debug as an argument to configure.  This will
            create a Berkeley DB library and utilities with debugging
            symbols, as well as load various routines that can be called
            from a debugger to display pages, cursor queues, and so forth.
            If installed, the utilities will not be stripped.  This

            <p>

            To build Berkeley DB with run-time debugging checks, enter
            --enable-diagnostic as an argument to configure.  This causes a
            number of additional checks to be performed when Berkeley DB is
            running, and also causes some failures to trigger process abort
            rather than returning errors to the application.  Applications
            built using this argument should not share database
            environments with applications built without this argument.
            This argument should not be specified when configuring to build
            production binaries.

            To convert Berkeley DB 1.85 (or earlier) databases to this
            release of Berkeley DB, enter --enable-dump185 as an argument
            to configure.  This will build the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_dump.html" class="olink">db_dump185</a> utility, which can dump
            Berkeley DB 1.85 and 1.86 databases in a format readable by the

            routines for this to work because the Berkeley DB distribution
            does not include them.  If you are using a non-standard library
            for the Berkeley DB 1.85 library routines, you will have to
            change the Makefile that the configuration step creates to load
            the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_dump.html" class="olink">db_dump185</a> utility with that library.

            To build the Berkeley DB Java API, enter --enable-java as an
            argument to configure. To build Java, you must also build with
            shared libraries.  Before configuring, you must set your PATH
            environment variable to include javac.  Note that it is not
            sufficient to include a symbolic link to javac in your PATH
            because the configuration process uses the location of javac to
            determine the location of the Java include files (for example,
            jni.h). On some systems, additional include directories may be
            needed to process jni.h; see <a class="xref" href="build_unix_flags.html" title="Changing compile or load options">Changing compile or load options</a> for more information.

            <span class="bold"><strong>--enable-posixmutexes</strong></span>
        </p>
            <p>
            To force Berkeley DB to use the POSIX pthread mutex interfaces
            for underlying mutex support, enter --enable-posixmutexes as an
            argument to configure.  This is rarely necessary: POSIX mutexes
            will be selected automatically on systems where they are the
            preferred implementation.
        </p>
            <p>
            The --enable-posixmutexes configuration argument is normally
            used in two ways: First, when there are multiple mutex
            implementations available and the POSIX mutex implementation is
            not the preferred one (for example, on Solaris where the LWP
            mutexes are used by default).  Second, by default the Berkeley
            DB library will only select the POSIX mutex implementation if
            it supports mutexes shared between multiple processes, as
            described for the pthread_condattr_setpshared and
            pthread_mutexattr_setpshared interfaces.  The
            --enable-posixmutexes configuration argument can be used to
            force the selection of POSIX mutexes in this case, which can
            improve application performance significantly when the
            alternative mutex implementation is a non-blocking one (for
            example test-and-set assembly instructions).  However,
            configuring to use POSIX mutexes when the implementation does
            not have inter-process support will only allow the creation of
            private database environments, that is, environments where the
            <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_PRIVATE" class="olink">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag is specified to the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> method.
        </p>
            <p>
            Specifying the --enable-posixmutexes configuration argument may require
            that applications and Berkeley DB be linked with the -lpthread library.

        </p>
            <p>
            To configure Berkeley DB for a POSIX pthreads application (with
            the exception that POSIX pthread mutexes may not be selected as
            the underlying mutex implementation for the build), enter
            --enable-pthread_api as an argument to configure.  The build
            will include the Berkeley DB replication manager interfaces and
            will use the POSIX standard pthread_self and pthread_yield
            functions to identify threads of control and yield the
            processor.  The --enable-pthread_api argument requires POSIX
            pthread support already be installed on your system.
        </p>
            <p>
            Specifying the --enable-pthread_api configuration argument may

            To build the command tool sqlite3, enter --enable-sql_compat as an argument to configure. Sqlite3 is a command line tool that enables you to manually enter and execute SQL
commands. It is identical to the dbsql executable but named so that existing scripts for SQLite can easily work with Berkeley DB. See

            The --enable-smallbuild argument is equivalent to individually
            specifying --with-cryptography=no, --disable-hash, --disable-heap,

            To build the Berkeley DB C++ STL API, enter --enable-stl as an
            argument to configure. Setting this argument implies that --enable-cxx is set,
	    and the Berkeley DB C++ API will be built too. 
	
        </p>
            <p>
	    There will be a libdb_stl-X.X.a and libdb_stl-X.X.so

        </p>
            <p>
	   If your compiler is not ISO C++ compliant, the configure may fail with this argument
	   specified because the STL API requires standard C++ template features. In this case,
	   you will need a standard C++ compiler. So far gcc is the best choice, we have tested and found
	   that gcc-3.4.4 and all its newer versions can build the Berkeley DB C++ STL API successfully.

            <p>
And you need to include the STL API header files in your application code.
If you are using the Berkeley DB source tree, the header files are in &lt;Berkeley DB Source Root &gt;/stl directory; 
If you 
are using the installed version, these header files are in &lt; Berkeley DB Installed Directory&gt;/include, as well as the

            --enable-uimutexes as an argument to configure.  This is rarely
            necessary: UI mutexes will be selected automatically on systems
            where they are the preferred implementation.
        </p>
            <p>
            The --enable-uimutexes configuration argument is normally used
            when there are multiple mutex implementations available and the
            UI mutex implementation is not the preferred one (for example,
            on Solaris where the LWP mutexes are used by default).
        </p>
            <p>
            Specifying the --enable-uimutexes configuration argument may
            require that applications and Berkeley DB be linked with the
            -lthread library.

            Rational Software's Purify product and other run-time tools
            complain about uninitialized reads/writes of structure fields

            was never initialized is written to disk.  Specify the
            --enable-umrw argument during configuration to mask these
            errors.  This argument should not be specified when configuring

	    To build Berkeley DB with performance event monitoring probes
	    add --enable-dtrace to the configuration options.  Both native
	    DTrace (on Solaris and Mac OS X) and the
	    Statically Defined Tracing compatibility layer
	    in Linux SystemTap version 1.1 or better are supported.
	    That compatibility package may be called systemtap-sdt-devel;
	    it includes <code class="filename">sys/sdt.h</code>.
        </p>
            <p>
	    If --enable-perfmon-statistics is combined with --enable-dtrace
	    then additional probes are defined for the tracking variables
	    from which DB's statistics are obtained.
	    They allow DTrace and SystemTap access to these values when
	    they are updated, are the basis of the statistics
	    as displayed db_stat and the API functions that return statistics.
        </p>
            <p>
	    The --enable-dtrace option may not be specified at the same time
	    as --disable-statistics.

            Causes all error messages to be stripped of their textual

            option should not be used when 
            <code class="literal">--enable-localization</code>
            is in use. Use of this build option can reduce your library

            <p>
            To force Berkeley DB to use a specific mutex implementation,
            configure with --with-mutex=MUTEX, where MUTEX is the mutex
            implementation you want.  For example,
            --with-mutex=x86/gcc-assembly will configure Berkeley DB to use
            the x86 GNU gcc compiler based test-and-set assembly mutexes.
            This is rarely necessary and should be done only when the
            default configuration selects the wrong mutex implementation.
            A list of available mutex implementations can be found in the
