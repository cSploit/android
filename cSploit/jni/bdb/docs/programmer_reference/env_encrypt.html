        Berkeley DB optionally supports encryption using the Rijndael/AES
        (also known as the Advanced Encryption Standard and Federal
        Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 197) algorithm for
        encryption or decryption.  The algorithm is configured to use a
        128-bit key.  Berkeley DB uses a 16-byte initialization vector
        generated using the Mersenne Twister.  All encrypted information is
        additionally checksummed using the SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm,
        using a 160-bit message digest.
    </p>
      <p>
        The encryption support provided with Berkeley DB is intended to
        protect applications from an attacker obtaining physical access to
        the media on which a Berkeley DB database is stored, or an attacker
        compromising a system on which Berkeley DB is running but who is
        unable to read system or process memory on that system.  
        <span class="bold"><strong>
            The encryption support provided with Berkeley DB will not
            protect applications from attackers able to read system memory

        To encrypt a database, you must configure the database for
        encryption prior to creating it. If you are using a database
        environment, you must also configure the environment for
        encryption.  In order to create an encrypted database within an
        environment,  you:
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                Configure the environment for encryption using the 
                <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_encrypt.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_encrypt()</a> method.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Open the database environment.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Specify the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbset_flags.html#dbset_flags_DB_ENCRYPT" class="olink">DB_ENCRYPT</a> flag to the database handle.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Open the database.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        Once you have done that, all of the databases that you create in
        the environment are encrypted/decrypted by the password you specify
        using the <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_encrypt.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_encrypt()</a> method.
    </p>
      <p>
        For databases not created in an environment:
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                Specify the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbset_flags.html#dbset_flags_DB_ENCRYPT" class="olink">DB_ENCRYPT</a> flag to the database handle.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Call the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbset_encrypt.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;set_encrypt()</a> method.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Open the database.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        Note that databases cannot be converted to an encrypted
        format after they have been created without dumping and re-creating
        them.  Finally, encrypted databases cannot be read on systems with
        a different endianness than the system that created the encrypted
        database.
    </p>
      <p>
        Each encrypted database environment (including all its encrypted
        databases) is encrypted using a single password and a single
        algorithm.  Applications wanting to provide a finer granularity of
        database access must either use multiple database environments or
        implement additional access controls outside of Berkeley DB.
    </p>
      <p>
        The only encrypted parts of a database environment are its
        databases and its log files. Specifically, the 
        <a class="xref" href="env_region.html" title="Shared memory regions">Shared memory regions</a> supporting
        the database environment are not encrypted.  For this reason, it
        may be possible for an attacker to read some or all of an encrypted
        database by reading the on-disk files that back these shared memory
        regions.  To prevent such attacks, applications may want to use
        in-memory filesystem support (on systems that support it), or the
        <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_PRIVATE" class="olink">DB_PRIVATE</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_SYSTEM_MEM" class="olink">DB_SYSTEM_MEM</a> flags to the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> method, to
        place the shared memory regions in memory that is never written to
        a disk.  As some systems page system memory to a backing disk, it
        is important to consider the specific operating system running on
        the machine as well.  Finally, when backing database environment
        shared regions with the filesystem, Berkeley DB can be configured
        to overwrite the shared regions before removing them by specifying
        the <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_flags.html#set_flags_DB_OVERWRITE" class="olink">DB_OVERWRITE</a> flag.  This option is only effective in the
        presence of fixed-block filesystems, journaling or logging
        filesystems will require operating system support and probably
        modification of the Berkeley DB sources.
    </p>
      <p>
        While all user data is encrypted, parts of the databases and log
        files in an encrypted environment are maintained in an unencrypted
        state.  Specifically, log record headers are not encrypted, only
        the actual log records.  Additionally, database internal page
        header fields are not encrypted.  These page header fields includes
        information such as the page's <a href="../api_reference/C/lsn.html" class="olink">DB_LSN</a> number and position in the
        database's sort order.
    </p>
      <p>
        Log records distributed by a replication master to replicated
        clients are transmitted to the clients in unencrypted form.  If
        encryption is desired in a replicated application, the use of a
        secure transport is strongly suggested.

        Berkeley DB 11g Release 2 supports encryption using Intel's
        Performance Primitive (IPP) on Linux. This works only on Intel
        processors.  To use Berkeley DB with IPP encryption, you must have
        IPP installed along with the cryptography extension. The IPP
        performance is higher in most cases compared to the current AES
        implementation.  See
