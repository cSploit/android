      <p>Managing distributed transactions and using the two-phase commit
protocol of Berkeley DB from an application requires the application to provide
the functionality of a global transaction manager (GTM).  The GTM is
responsible for the following:</p>

          <li>Maintaining state information about each distributed transaction.</li>
          <li>Recovering from failures of individual environments.</li>
          <li>Recovering the global transaction state after failure of the global

        <p>Two-phase commit is required if a transaction spans operations 
in multiple Berkeley DB environments or across operations in Berkeley DB 
and some other database systems.  If the environments
reside on the same machine, the application can communicate with each
environment through its own address space with no additional complexity.
If the environments reside on separate machines, the application 

may use its own messaging capability, translating messages on the remote
machine into calls into the Berkeley DB library (including the recovery
calls). </p>

        <p>If the GTM fails, it must first recover its local state.  Assuming the

        </div>
        <p>A global transaction is a transaction that spans multiple environments.
Each global transaction must have a unique transaction ID.  This unique
ID is the global transaction ID (GID).  In Berkeley DB, global transaction IDs 
must be represented by the character array, <code class="literal">DB_GID_SIZE</code> (currently 128 bytes).  
It is the responsibility of the
global transaction manager to assign GIDs, guarantee their uniqueness,
and manage the mapping of local transactions to GID.  That is, for each
GID, the GTM should know which local transaction managers participated.
The Berkeley DB logging system or a Berkeley DB table could be used to record this
information.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="idp2291232"></a>Maintaining state for each distributed transaction.</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In addition to knowing which local environments participate in each
global transaction, the GTM must also know the state of each active
global transaction.  As soon as a transaction becomes distributed (that
is, a second environment participates), the GTM must record the
existence of the global transaction and all participants (whether this
must reside on stable storage or not depends on the exact configuration
of the system).  As new environments participate, the GTM must keep this
information up to date.</p>
        <p>When the GTM is ready to begin commit processing, it should issue
<a href="../api_reference/C/txnprepare.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;prepare()</a> calls to each participating environment, indicating
the GID of the global transaction.  Once all the participants have
successfully prepared, then the GTM must record that the global
transaction will be committed.   This record should go to stable
storage.  Once written to stable storage, the GTM can send
<a href="../api_reference/C/txncommit.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;commit()</a> requests to each participating environment.  Once
all environments have successfully completed the commit, the GTM can
either record the successful commit or can somehow "forget" the global
transaction.</p>
        <p>
If an application uses nested transactions (that is, the 
parent parameter is non-NULL in a call to <a href="../api_reference/C/txnbegin.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_begin()</a>)
 then, only the parent transaction should call <a href="../api_reference/C/txnprepare.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;prepare()</a>, not any of the child transactions.
</p>
        <p>Should any participant fail to prepare, then the GTM must abort the
global transaction.  The fact that the transaction is going to be
aborted should be written to stable storage.  Once written, the GTM can
then issue <a href="../api_reference/C/txnabort.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;abort()</a> requests to each environment.  When all
aborts have returned successfully, the GTM can either record the
successful abort or "forget" the global transaction.</p>
        <p>In summary, for each transaction, the GTM must maintain the following:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>A list of participating environments</li>
            <li>The current state of each transaction (pre-prepare, preparing,
committing, aborting, done)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="idp2336712"></a>Recovering from the failure of a single environment</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>If a single environment fails, there is no need to bring down or recover other environments (the only exception to this is if all environments are managed in the same application address space and there is a risk that the failure of the environment corrupted other environments).  Instead, once the failing environment comes back up, it should be recovered (that is, conventional recovery, via the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility or by specifying the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> flag to <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> should be run).  If the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility is used, then the -e option must be specified.  In this case, the application will almost certainly want to specify environmental parameters via a <a class="xref" href="env_db_config.html" title="DB_CONFIG configuration file">DB_CONFIG configuration file</a> in the environment's home directory, so that the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility can create an appropriately configured environment.  
If the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility is not used, then the GTM should call <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> specifying the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> flag.  It should then call <a href="../api_reference/C/txnrecover.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover()</a>, which will return an array of DB_TXN handles for the set of prepared, but not yet completed transactions.  For each transaction, the GTM should combine this knowledge with its transaction state table and call either  <a href="../api_reference/C/txncommit.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;commit()</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/txnabort.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;abort()</a>.  After that process is complete, the environment is ready to participate in new transactions.
</p>
        <p>If the GTM is running in a system with multiple GTMs, it is possible that some of the transactions returned via <a href="../api_reference/C/txnrecover.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover()</a> do not belong to the current environment.  The GTM should detect this and call <a href="../api_reference/C/txndiscard.html" class="olink">DB_TXN-&gt;discard()</a> on each such transaction handle.  Furthermore, it is important to note the environment does not retain information about which GTM has issued <a href="../api_reference/C/txnrecover.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover()</a> operations.  Therefore, each GTM should issue all its <a href="../api_reference/C/txnrecover.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover()</a> calls before another GTM issues its calls.  If the calls are interleaved, each GTM may not get a complete and consistent set of transactions.  The simplest way to enforce this is for each GTM to make sure it can receive all its outstanding transactions in a single <a href="../api_reference/C/txnrecover.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover()</a> call.  The maximum number of possible outstanding transactions is roughly the maximum number of active transactions in the environment (whose value can be obtained using the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_stat.html" class="olink">db_stat</a> utility).  To simplify this procedure, the caller should allocate an array large enough to hold the list of transactions (for example, allocate an array able to hold three times the maximum number of transactions).  If that is not possible, callers should check that the array was not completely filled in when <a href="../api_reference/C/txnrecover.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover()</a> returns.  If the array was completely filled in, each transaction should be explicitly discarded, and the call repeated with a larger array.</p>
        <p>The newly recovered environment will forbid any new transactions from being started until the prepared but not yet completed transactions have been resolved.  In the multiple GTM case, this means that all GTMs must recover before any GTM can begin issuing new transactions.</p>
        <p>
The GTM must determine how long it needs to retain global transaction commit and abort records. If the participating environments are following a DB_TXN_SYNC policy, that is, they are forcing commit and abort records to disk before replying to the GTM, then once the GTM has heard from all participants, it need not retain its persistent log records.  However, if participating environments are running at weaker durability levels, such as <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_flags.html#set_flags_DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC" class="olink">DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_flags.html#envset_flags_DB_TXN_NOSYNC" class="olink">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</a>, then the GTM must retain all commit and abort records until all participants have completed a checkpoint following the completion of a transaction.
