      <p>
        One of the benefits of replication is that it helps your
        application remain available for writes even when a site crashes.
        Another benefit is the added durability achieved by storing multiple
        copies of your application data at different sites.  However, if
        your replication group contains only two sites, you must prioritize
        which of these benefits is more important to your
        application.
    </p>
      <p>
        A two-site replication group is particularly vulnerable to
        duplicate masters if there is a loss of communication between the
        sites.  The original master continues to accept new transactions.
        If the original client detects the loss of the master and elects
        itself master, it also starts accepting new transactions.  When
        communications are restored, there are duplicate masters and one
        site's new transactions will be rolled back.
    </p>
      <p>
        If it is unacceptable to your application for any new transactions
        to be rolled back, the alternative in a two-site replication group
        is to require both sites to be present in order to elect a master.
        This stops a client from electing itself master when it loses
        contact with the master and prevents creation of parallel sets of
        transactions, one of which must be rolled back.
    </p>
      <p>
        However, requiring both sites to be present to elect a master
        results in a loss of write availability when the master crashes.
        The client cannot take over as master and the replication group
        exists in a read-only state until the original master site rejoins
        the replication group.
    </p>
      <p>
        Replication Manager applications use the <a href="../api_reference/C/repconfig.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_config()</a> method
        <a href="../api_reference/C/repconfig.html#config_DB_REPMGR_CONF_2SITE_STRICT" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_CONF_2SITE_STRICT</a> flag to make this tradeoff between
        write availability and transaction durability.  When this flag is
        turned on, Replication Manager favors transaction durability.  When
        it is turned off, Replication Manager favors write
        availability.
    </p>
      <p>
        A two-site Replication Manager application that uses heartbeats in
        an environment with frequent communications disruptions generally
        should operate with the <a href="../api_reference/C/repconfig.html#config_DB_REPMGR_CONF_2SITE_STRICT" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_CONF_2SITE_STRICT</a> flag turned
        on.  Otherwise, frequent heartbeat failures will cause frequent
        duplicate masters and the resulting elections and client
        synchronizations will make one or both sites unavailable for
        extended periods of time.
    </p>
      <p>
        Base API applications use the values of the 
        <span class="bold"><strong>nvotes</strong></span> and 
        <span class="bold"><strong>nsites</strong></span> parameters in calls to the
        <a href="../api_reference/C/repelect.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect()</a> method to make this tradeoff.  For more information, see
        <a class="xref" href="rep_elect.html" title="Elections">Elections</a>.</p>
      <p>
        A replication group containing only two electable sites is subject
        to duplicate masters and rollback of one site's new transactions
        even when it contains additional unelectable sites.  The
        <a href="../api_reference/C/repconfig.html#config_DB_REPMGR_CONF_2SITE_STRICT" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_CONF_2SITE_STRICT</a> does not apply in this case because
        the replication group is larger than two sites.
    </p>
      <p>
        If both write availability and transaction durability are important
        to your application, you should strongly consider having three or
        more electable sites in your replication group.  You should also
        carefully choose an acknowledgement policy that requires at least a
        quorum of sites.  It is best to have an odd number of electable
        sites to provide a clear majority in the event of a network
        partition.
