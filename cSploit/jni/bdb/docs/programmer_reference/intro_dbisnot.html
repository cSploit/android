      <p>
        In contrast to most other database systems, Berkeley DB provides relatively
        simple data access services.
    </p>
      <p>
        Records in Berkeley DB are (<span class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span>,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>) pairs. Berkeley DB supports only a few
        logical operations on records. They are:
    </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Insert a record in a table.</li>
          <li>Delete a record from a table.</li>
          <li>Find a record in a table by looking up its key.</li>
          <li>Update a record that has already been found.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Notice that Berkeley DB never operates on the value part of a
        record.  Values are simply payload, to be stored with keys and
        reliably delivered back to the application on demand.
    </p>
      <p>
        Both keys and values can be arbitrary byte strings, either
        fixed-length or variable-length. As a result, programmers can put
        native programming language data structures into the database
        without converting them to a foreign record format first. Storage
        and retrieval are very simple, but the application needs to know
        what the structure of a key and a value is in advance. It cannot
        ask Berkeley DB, because Berkeley DB doesn't know.
    </p>
      <p>
        This is an important feature of Berkeley DB, and one worth
        considering more carefully.  On the one hand, Berkeley DB cannot
        provide the programmer with any information on the contents or
        structure of the values that it stores.  The application must
        understand the keys and values that it uses.  On the other hand,
        there is literally no limit to the data types that can be store in
        a Berkeley DB database. The application never needs to convert its
        own program data into the data types that Berkeley DB supports.
        Berkeley DB is able to operate on any data type the application
        uses, no matter how complex.
    </p>
      <p>
        Because both keys and values can be up to four gigabytes in length,
        a single record can store images, audio streams, or other large
        data values.  By default large values are not treated specially in
        Berkeley DB. They are simply broken into page-sized chunks, and
        reassembled on demand when the application needs them. However, you
        can configure Berkeley DB to treat large objects in a special way,
        so that they are accessed in a more efficient manner. Note that
        these specially-treated large objects are not confined to the four
        gigabyte limit used for other database objects. See
        <a class="xref" href="blobs.html" title="BLOB support">BLOB support</a>
        for more information.

        <p>
            While Berkeley DB does provide a set of optional SQL APIs,
            usually all access to data stored in Berkeley DB is performed
            using the traditional Berkeley DB APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The traditional Berkeley DB APIs are the way that most Berkeley DB
            users will use Berkeley DB.  Although the
            interfaces are fairly simple, they are non-standard in that they
            do not support SQL statements.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, Berkeley DB does provide a set of SQL APIs that behave
            nearly identically to SQLite. By using these APIs you can interface
            with Berkeley DB using SQL statements. For Unix systems, these APIs
            are not available by default, while for Windows systems they are
            available by default. For more information, see the
            <em class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Getting Started with the SQL APIs</em> guide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be aware that SQL support is a double-edged sword. One big advantage of
            relational databases is that they allow users to write simple
            declarative queries in a high-level language. The database system
            knows everything about the data and can carry out the command. This
            means that it's simple to search for data in new ways, and to ask
            new questions of the database.  No programming is required.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, if a programmer can predict in advance how an
            application will access data, then writing a low-level program to
            get and store records can be faster. It eliminates the overhead of
            query parsing, optimization, and execution. The programmer must
            understand the data representation, and must write the code to do
            the work, but once that's done, the application can be very fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless Berkeley DB is used with its SQL APIs, it has no notion of
            <span class="emphasis"><em>schema</em></span> and data types in the way that
            relational systems do. Schema is the structure of records in
            tables, and the relationships among the tables in the database. For
            example, in a relational system the programmer can create a record
            from a fixed menu of data types.  Because the record types are
            declared to the system, the relational engine can reach inside
            records and examine individual values in them. In addition,
            programmers can use SQL to declare relationships among tables, and
            to create indices on tables.  Relational engines usually maintain
            these relationships and indices automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Berkeley DB, the key and value in a record are opaque to
            Berkeley DB. They may have a rich internal structure, but the
            library is unaware of it. As a result, Berkeley DB cannot decompose
            the value part of a record into its constituent parts, and cannot
            use those parts to find values of interest. Only the application,
            which knows the data structure, can do that.  Berkeley DB does
            support indices on tables and automatically maintain those indices
            as their associated tables are modified.
        </p>
        <p>
            Berkeley DB is not a relational system. Relational database systems
            are semantically rich and offer high-level database access.
            Compared to such systems, Berkeley DB is a high-performance,
            transactional library for record storage. It is possible to build a
            relational system on top of Berkeley DB (indeed, this is what the
            Berkeley DB SQL API really is). In fact, the popular MySQL
            relational system uses Berkeley DB for transaction-protected table
            management, and takes care of all the SQL parsing and execution. It
            uses Berkeley DB for the storage level, and provides the semantics
            and access tools.

        </div>
        <p>
            Object-oriented databases are designed for very tight integration
            with object-oriented programming languages. Berkeley DB is written
            entirely in the C programming language. It includes language
            bindings for C++, Java, and other languages, but the library has no
            information about the objects created in any object-oriented
            application. Berkeley DB never makes method calls on any
            application object. It has no idea what methods are defined on user
            objects, and cannot see the public or private members of any
            instance.  The key and value part of all records are opaque to
            Berkeley DB.
        </p>
        <p>
            Berkeley DB cannot automatically page in objects as they are
            accessed, as some object-oriented databases do. The object-oriented
            application programmer must decide what records are required, and
            must fetch them by making method calls on Berkeley DB objects.

        <p>
            Berkeley DB does not support network-style navigation among
            records, as network databases do. Records in a Berkeley DB table
            may move around over time, as new records are added to the table
            and old ones are deleted.  Berkeley DB is able to do fast searches
            for records based on keys, but there is no way to create a
            persistent physical pointer to a record.  Applications can only
            refer to records by key, not by address.

        <p>
            Berkeley DB is not a standalone database server. It is a library,
            and runs in the address space of the application that uses it. If
            more than one application links in Berkeley DB, then all can use
            the same database at the same time; the library handles
            coordination among the applications, and guarantees that they do
            not interfere with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to build a server application that uses Berkeley DB
            for data management. For example, many commercial and open source
            Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers use Berkeley
            DB for record storage.  LDAP clients connect to these servers over
            the network. Individual servers make calls through the Berkeley DB
            API to find records and return them to clients. On its own,
            however, Berkeley DB is not a server.
