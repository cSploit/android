      <p>
        A <span class="bold"><strong>view</strong></span> is a replication site
        that maintains a copy of the replication group's data without
        incurring other overhead from participating in the replication
        group.  Views are useful for applications that require read
        scalability, are geographically distributed, have slow network
        connections to some sites, or require only a subset of replicated
        databases at some sites.
    </p>
      <p>
        A client is a <span class="bold"><strong>participant</strong></span> in the
        replication group because it helps to determine the master and
        contributes to transaction durability.  A view receives its copy of
        the replicated data without participating in the replication group
        in these other ways.  Specifically, a view cannot ever become master,
        a view does not vote in elections, and a view does not contribute
        to transaction durability.  A view is similar to an unelectable client
        because neither can become master.  They differ because an unelectable
        client participates in the replication group by voting and
        contributing to transaction durability.
    </p>
      <p>
        A <span class="bold"><strong>full view</strong></span> contains a copy of
        all replicated databases.  You define a full view by calling the
        <a href="../api_reference/C/repset_view.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_view()</a> method before opening the environment and supplying a
        NULL value for the  <span class="bold"><strong>partial_func</strong></span>
        parameter.  You can then complete any other environment configuration,
        open the environment, and eventually start replication using the
        <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrstart.html#repmgrstart_DB_REP_CLIENT" class="olink">DB_REP_CLIENT</a> flags value.
    </p>
      <p>
        A <span class="bold"><strong>partial view</strong></span> contains a subset
        of the replicated databases.  You define a partial view using the
        same steps used to define a full view, except that you supply a
        <span class="bold"><strong>partial_func</strong></span> callback to the
        <a href="../api_reference/C/repset_view.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_view()</a> method.  The partial function uses application-specific
        logic to determine the names of the database files to replicate.
        The partial function should set its
        <span class="bold"><strong>result</strong></span> output parameter to 0 to
        reject a database file or to a non-zero value to replicate it.
        Note that named in-memory databases are always replicated to partial
        views regardless of partial function logic.
    </p>
      <p>
        The decision about whether to replicate a particular database file
        to a partial view is made at the time the database file is first
        created.  It is possible to change the partial function to replicate
        a different set of database files.  However, any database file that
        was already being replicated will continue to be replicated
        regardless of the new partial function logic because it already exists
        at that site.
    </p>
      <p>
        Recovery on a partial view should always be performed using the
        <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> flag to the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> method after calling the
        <a href="../api_reference/C/repset_view.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_view()</a> method to supply the partial function.  You should not use
        the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility to recover a partial view because it cannot use a
        partial function.
    </p>
      <p>
        Defining a site as a view is a permanent decision; once a site is
        defined as a view it can never be transformed into a participant.
        This means that on a view site, the <a href="../api_reference/C/repset_view.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_view()</a> method must always be
        called before opening the environment.
    </p>
      <p>
        An existing participant can be permanently demoted to a view at any
        time by calling the <a href="../api_reference/C/repset_view.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_view()</a> method before opening its environment
        and starting replication.
        Demoting a participant to a view can fail when starting replication
        and return
        <code class="literal">DB_REP_UNAVAIL</code> if the master is unavailable or
        there are insufficient participants to acknowledge this operation.
        You can pause and retry starting replication until it succeeds.
    </p>
      <p>
        A view cannot become master and does not vote in elections,
        but elections among the participant sites need to know the
        number of participants in the replication group.  Replication Manager
        automatically manages elections and tracks the number of participants.
        In Base API applications, the number of sites in the replication
        group set by the <a href="../api_reference/C/repnsites.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_nsites()</a> method should only count participant
        sites.  Similarly, when a participant site calls the <a href="../api_reference/C/repelect.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect()</a> method,
        the <span class="bold"><strong>nsites</strong></span> value should only count
        participant sites.  A view should never call the <a href="../api_reference/C/repelect.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect()</a> method.
    </p>
      <p>
        A transaction's durability within a replication group is based on
        its replication to other sites that can potentially take over as master
        if the current master fails.  A view cannot become master, so it cannot
        contribute to transaction durabilty.  As a result, Replication Manager
        views do not send acknowledgements.  Base API applications should not
        count messages returning <a href="../api_reference/C/repmessage.html#repmsg_DB_REP_ISPERM" class="olink">DB_REP_ISPERM</a> from a view as contributing
        to transaction durability.
     </p>
      <p>
        Replication Manager views participate in replication group-aware
        log archiving.  A view can also be configured as a client-to-client
        peer of another site in the replication group.  If a partial view does
        not contain the information requested, Replication Manager will
        redirect the request to the master.
