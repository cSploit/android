    Except for the historic <a href="../api_reference/C/dbm.html" class="olink">dbm</a>, <a href="../api_reference/C/dbm.html" class="olink">ndbm</a> and <a href="../api_reference/C/hsearch.html" class="olink">hsearch</a> interfaces, Berkeley DB
    does not use the global variable <code class="literal">errno</code> to return
    error values.  The return values for all Berkeley DB functions are
    grouped into the following three categories:
</p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">0</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>A return value of 0 indicates that the operation was successful.</dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">&gt; 0</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>A return value that is greater than 0 indicates that there was a system
error.  The <span class="bold"><strong>errno</strong></span> value returned by the system is returned by
the function; for example, when a Berkeley DB function is unable to allocate
memory, the return value from the function will be ENOMEM.</dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">&lt; 0</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>A return value that is less than 0 indicates a condition that was not
a system failure, but was not an unqualified success, either.  For
example, a routine to retrieve a key/data pair from the database may
return DB_NOTFOUND when the key/data pair does not appear in
the database; as opposed to the value of 0, which would be returned if
the key/data pair were found in the database.
<p>
All values returned by Berkeley DB functions are less than 0 in order to avoid
conflict with possible values of <span class="bold"><strong>errno</strong></span>.  Specifically, Berkeley DB
reserves all values from -30,800 to -30,999 to itself as possible error
values.  There are a few Berkeley DB interfaces where it is possible for an
application function to be called by a Berkeley DB function and subsequently
fail with an application-specific return.  Such failure returns will be
passed back to the function that originally called a Berkeley DB interface.
To avoid ambiguity about the cause of the error, error values separate
from the Berkeley DB error name space should be used.</p></dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <p>
    Although possible error returns are specified by each individual
    function's manual page, there are a few error returns that deserve
    general mention:
</p>
      <p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>DB_NOTFOUND and DB_KEYEMPTY</strong></span>
</p>
      <p>There are two special return values that are similar in meaning and that
are returned in similar situations, and therefore might be confused:
DB_NOTFOUND and DB_KEYEMPTY.</p>
      <p><a id="program_errorret.DB_NOTFOUND"></a>The DB_NOTFOUND error return indicates that the requested key/data
pair did not exist in the database or that start-of- or end-of-file has
been reached by a cursor.</p>
      <p><a id="program_errorret.DB_KEYEMPTY"></a>The DB_KEYEMPTY error return indicates that the requested
key/data pair logically exists but was never explicitly created by the
application (the Recno and Queue access methods will automatically
create key/data pairs under some circumstances; see <a href="../api_reference/C/dbopen.html" class="olink">DB-&gt;open()</a>
for more information), or that the requested key/data pair was deleted
and never re-created.  In addition, the Queue access method will return
DB_KEYEMPTY for records that were created as part of a
transaction that was later aborted and never re-created.</p>
      <p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>DB_KEYEXIST</strong></span>
</p>
      <p><a id="program_errorret.DB_KEYEXIST"></a>
    The DB_KEYEXIST error return indicates the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbput.html#put_DB_NOOVERWRITE" class="olink">DB_NOOVERWRITE</a> option was specified
    when inserting a key/data pair into the database and the key already
    exists in the database, or the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbput.html#put_DB_NODUPDATA" class="olink">DB_NODUPDATA</a> option was specified and the
    key/data pair already exists in the data.
</p>
      <p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</strong></span>
</p>
      <p><a id="program_errorret.DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK"></a>
    When multiple threads of control are modifying the database, there is
    normally the potential for deadlock. In Berkeley DB, deadlock is
    signified by an error return from the Berkeley DB function of the value
    DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK.  Whenever a Berkeley DB function returns
    DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK, the enclosing transaction should be aborted.
</p>
      <p>
    Any Berkeley DB function that attempts to acquire locks can potentially
    return DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK.  Practically speaking, the safest way to deal
    with applications that can deadlock is to anticipate a DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK
    return from any <a href="../api_reference/C/db.html" class="olink">DB</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/dbc.html" class="olink">DBC</a> handle method call, or any <a href="../api_reference/C/env.html" class="olink">DB_ENV</a>
    handle method call that references a database, including the database's
    backing physical file.
</p>
      <p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED</strong></span>
</p>
      <p><a id="program_errorret.DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED"></a>
    If a lock is requested from the <a href="../api_reference/C/lockget.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;lock_get()</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/lockvec.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;lock_vec()</a> methods with the 
    <a href="../api_reference/C/lockvec.html#vec_DB_LOCK_NOWAIT" class="olink">DB_LOCK_NOWAIT</a> flag specified, the method will return DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED if the lock
    is not immediately available.
</p>
      <p>
    If the <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_flags.html#envset_flags_DB_TIME_NOTGRANTED" class="olink">DB_TIME_NOTGRANTED</a> flag is specified to the <a href="../api_reference/C/envset_flags.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_flags()</a> method,
    database calls timing out based on lock or transaction timeout values
    will return DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED instead of DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK.
</p>
      <p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>DB_RUNRECOVERY</strong></span>
</p>
      <p><a id="program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY"></a>
    There exists a class of errors that Berkeley DB considers fatal to an
    entire Berkeley DB environment.  An example of this type of error is a
    corrupted database page.  The only way to recover from these failures
    is to have all threads of control exit the Berkeley DB environment, run
    recovery of the environment, and re-enter Berkeley DB. (It is not
    strictly necessary that the processes exit, although that is the only
    way to recover system resources, such as file descriptors and memory,
    allocated by Berkeley DB.)
</p>
      <p>
    When this type of error is encountered, the error value DB_RUNRECOVERY
    is returned. This error can be returned by any Berkeley DB interface.
    Once DB_RUNRECOVERY is returned by any interface, it will be returned
    from all subsequent Berkeley DB calls made by any threads of control
    participating in the environment.
</p>
      <p>
    Applications can handle such fatal errors in one of two ways: first, by
    checking for DB_RUNRECOVERY as part of their normal Berkeley DB error
    return checking, similarly to DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK or any other error.
    Alternatively, applications can specify a fatal-error callback function
    using the <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;set_event_notify()</a> method.  Applications with no cleanup
    processing of their own should simply exit from the callback function.
</p>
      <p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>DB_SECONDARY_BAD</strong></span>
</p>
      <p><a id="program_error_ret.DB_SECONDARY_BAD"></a>
    The DB_SECONDARY_BAD error is returned if a secondary index has been
    corrupted.  This may be the result of an application operating on
    related databases without first associating them.
