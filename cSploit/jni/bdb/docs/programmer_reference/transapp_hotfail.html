      <p>
        For some applications, it may be useful to periodically snapshot
        the database environment for use as a hot failover should the
        primary system fail.  The following steps can be taken to keep a
        backup environment in close synchrony with an active environment.
        The active environment is entirely unaffected by these procedures,
        and both read and write operations are allowed during all steps
        described here.
    </p>
      <p>
        The procedure described here is not compatible with the concurrent
        use of the transactional bulk insert optimization (transactions
        started with the <a href="../api_reference/C/txnbegin.html#txnbegin_DB_TXN_BULK" class="olink">DB_TXN_BULK</a> flag). After the bulk optimization
        is used, the archive must be created again from scratch starting
        with step 1.
    </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="../api_reference/C/db_hotbackup.html" class="olink">db_hotbackup</a> utility is the preferred way to automate generating a hot
        failover system.  The first step is to run <a href="../api_reference/C/db_hotbackup.html" class="olink">db_hotbackup</a> utility without the
        <span class="bold"><strong>-u</strong></span> flag.  This will create hot
        backup copy of the databases in your environment.  After that point
        periodically running the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_hotbackup.html" class="olink">db_hotbackup</a> utility with the 
        <span class="bold"><strong>-u</strong></span> flag will copy the new
        log files and run recovery on the backup copy to bring it current
        with the primary environment.
    </p>
      <p>
        Note that you can also create your own hot backup solution using
        the <a href="../api_reference/C/envbackup.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;backup()</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/envdbbackup.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;dbbackup()</a> methods.
    </p>
      <p>
        To implement your own hot fail over system, the steps below can be
        followed. However, care should be taken on non-UNIX based systems
        when copying the database files to be sure that they are either
        quiescent, or that either the <a href="../api_reference/C/envbackup.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;backup()</a> or <a href="../api_reference/C/db_copy.html" class="olink">db_copy()</a> routine is
        used to ensure atomic reads of the database pages.
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">

                Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_archive.html" class="olink">db_archive</a> utility with the <span class="bold"><strong>-s</strong></span> option in the active environment
                to identify all of the active environment's database files, and
                copy them to the backup directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the database files are stored in a separate directory from
                the other Berkeley DB files, it will be simpler (and much
                faster!) to copy the directory itself instead of the individual
                files (see <a href="../api_reference/C/envadd_data_dir.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;add_data_dir()</a> for additional information).

              <p>
                    If any of the database files did not have an open <a href="../api_reference/C/db.html" class="olink">DB</a>
                    handle during the lifetime of the current log files,
                    the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_archive.html" class="olink">db_archive</a> utility will not list them in its output. This
                    is another reason it may be simpler to use a separate
                    database file directory and copy the entire directory
                    instead of archiving only the files listed by the
                    <a href="../api_reference/C/db_archive.html" class="olink">db_archive</a> utility.

          <li>
            Remove all existing log files from the backup directory.
        </li>
          <li>
            Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_archive.html" class="olink">db_archive</a> utility with the <span class="bold"><strong>-l</strong></span>
            option in the active environment to identify all of the active
            environment's log files, and copy them to the backup directory.

          <li>
            Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility with the <span class="bold"><strong>-c</strong></span>

            copied environment.
        </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        Steps 2, 3 and 4 may be repeated as often as you like.  If Step 1
        (the initial copy of the database files) is repeated, then Steps 2,
        3 and 4 <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> be performed at least
        once in order to ensure a consistent database environment
        snapshot.
    </p>
      <p>
        These procedures must be integrated with your other archival
        procedures, of course.  If you are periodically removing log files
        from your active environment, you must be sure to copy them to the
        backup directory before removing them from the active directory.
        Not copying a log file to the backup directory and subsequently
        running recovery with it present may leave the backup snapshot of
        the environment corrupted.  A simple way to ensure this never
        happens is to archive the log files in Step 2 as you remove them
        from the backup directory, and move inactive log files from your
        active environment into your backup directory (rather than copying
        them), in Step 3.  The following steps describe this procedure in
        more detail:
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_archive.html" class="olink">db_archive</a> utility with the <span class="bold"><strong>-s</strong></span>
            option in the active environment to identify all of the active
            environment's database files, and copy them to the backup
            directory.
        </li>
          <li>
            Archive all existing log files from the backup directory, moving them
            to a backup device such as CD-ROM, alternate disk, or tape.
        </li>
          <li>
            Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_archive.html" class="olink">db_archive</a> utility (without any option) in the active environment
            to identify all of the log files in the active environment that are
            no longer in use, and <span class="bold"><strong>move</strong></span> them to
            the backup directory.
        </li>
          <li>
            Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_archive.html" class="olink">db_archive</a> utility with the <span class="bold"><strong>-l</strong></span>
            option in the active environment to identify all of the remaining
            log files in the active environment, and <span class="bold"><strong>copy</strong></span> the log files to the backup
            directory.
        </li>
          <li>

      <p>
        As before, steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 may be repeated as often as you
        like.  If Step 1 (the initial copy of the database files) is
        repeated, then Steps 2 through 5 
        <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> be performed at least once in
        order to ensure a consistent database environment snapshot.
