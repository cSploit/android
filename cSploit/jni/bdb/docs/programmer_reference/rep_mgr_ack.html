      <p>Replication Manager allows the user to choose from a variety of
acknowledgement policies.  There are two characteristics that should
be considered when choosing the policy: consistency and durability.
Consistency means making sure some number of clients have applied
all available master transactions.  Durability, in this context,
means only indicating success only if enough clients have
applied a transaction.  The issue of how many is enough depends
on the application's requirements and varies per acknowledgement policy.
For example, <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_QUORUM" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_QUORUM</a> means the data will survive
a change in master or a network partition.
In most cases, the number of sites for consistency is 
equal to the number of sites for durability.  Replication Manager
uses the consistency value to decide whether or not to wait for
acknowledgements.  Replication manager uses the durability value
to decide either the transaction was successfully processed or that
a <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html#event_notify_DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED" class="olink">DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED</a> event should be generated.</p>
      <p>Replication Manager also strives to give the application the
answer and return to the application as quickly as possible.  Therefore,
if it knows that the number of sites connected is insufficient to meet
the consistency value, then it does not wait for any acknowledgements
and if it knows that the durability value cannot be met, it returns
<a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html#event_notify_DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED" class="olink">DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED</a> immediately to the user.</p>
      <p>With one exception, discussed below, all acknowledgement policies combine
the consistency and durability values.  For most policies the primary
purpose is the durability of the data.  For example, the <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_QUORUM" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_QUORUM</a>
policy ensures that, if successful, the transaction's data is safe in
the event of a network partition so that a majority of the sites in
the group have the data.  The <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_NONE" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_NONE</a> policy does not
consider either consistency or durability, and it is very
fast because it does not wait for any acknowledgements and it does not
ever trigger the <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html#event_notify_DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED" class="olink">DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED</a> event.  Other policies,
<a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL</a> and <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_PEERS" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_PEERS</a>, have a primary purpose of
consistency.  These two policies wait for acknowledgements from all
(or all electable) sites in the group.</p>
      <p>In the face of failure, however, the <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL</a> and
<a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_PEERS" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_PEERS</a> policies can result
in a surprising lack of consistency due to the fact that Replication Manager
strives to give the answer back to the application as fast as it can.
So, for example, with <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL</a>, and one site down, Replication
Manager knows that disconnected site can never acknowledge, so it
immediately triggers <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html#event_notify_DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED" class="olink">DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED</a>.  An unfortunate side
effect of this policy is that existing, running sites may fall further and
further behind the master if the master site is sending a fast, busy
stream of transactions and never waiting for any site to send an
acknowledgement.  The master does not wait because the consistency
value cannot be met, and it does trigger the <a href="../api_reference/C/envevent_notify.html#event_notify_DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED" class="olink">DB_EVENT_REP_PERM_FAILED</a>
event because the durability value cannot be met, but those
actions now affect the consistency of the other running sites.</p>
      <p>In order to counteract this unfortunate side effect,
the <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_AVAILABLE" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_AVAILABLE</a> acknowledgement policy focuses on the
consistency aspect, but also considers durability.  This policy
uses all sites for consistency,
and a quorum of sites for its decision about durability.  As long
as there is a non-zero number of client replicas to send to, the
master will wait for all available sites to acknowledge the
transaction.  As long as any client site is connected, this policy
will prevent the master from racing ahead if one or more sites is down.
On the master, this policy will then consider the transaction durable if
the number of acknowledgements meets quorum for the group.</p>
      <p>The following acknowledgement policies determine durability
using acknowledgements from electable peers only: <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_QUORUM" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_QUORUM</a>,
<a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ONE_PEER" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ONE_PEER</a>, <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrset_ack_policy.html#ackspolicy_DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_PEERS" class="olink">DB_REPMGR_ACKS_ALL_PEERS</a>.  An electable
peer is a site where the priority value is greater than zero.  In
replication groups using these policies, an unelectable site does not
send acknowledgements and cannot contribute to transaction durability.</p>
