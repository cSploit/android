      <p>
        The fifth component of the infrastructure, recovery procedures,
        concerns the recoverability of the database.  After any application or
        system failure, there are two possible approaches to database recovery:
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                There is no need for recoverability, and all databases can be
                re-created from scratch.  Although these applications may still
                need transaction protection for other reasons, recovery usually
                consists of removing the Berkeley DB environment home directory
                and all files it contains, and then restarting the application.
                Such an application may use the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbset_flags.html#dbset_flags_DB_TXN_NOT_DURABLE" class="olink">DB_TXN_NOT_DURABLE</a> flag to
                avoid writing log records.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                It is necessary to recover information after system or application
                failure.  In this case, recovery processing must be performed on
                any database environments that were active at the time of the
                failure.  Recovery processing involves running the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility or
                calling the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> method with the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> or
                <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER_FATAL" class="olink">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> flags.
            </p>
            <p>
                During recovery processing, all database changes made by aborted or
                unfinished transactions are undone, and all database changes made
                by committed transactions are redone, as necessary.  Database
                applications must not be restarted until recovery completes.  After
                recovery finishes, the environment is properly initialized so that
                applications may be restarted.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        If performing recovery, there are two types of recovery processing:
        <span class="emphasis"><em>normal</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>catastrophic</em></span>.
        Which you choose depends on the source for the database and log files
        you are using to recover.
    </p>
      <p>
        If up-to-the-minute database and log files are accessible on a stable
        filesystem, normal recovery is sufficient.  Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility or
        call the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> method specifying the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER" class="olink">DB_RECOVER</a> flag.  However, the
        normal recovery case <span class="bold"><strong>never</strong></span> includes
        recovery using hot backups of the database environment.  For example,
        you cannot perform a hot backup of databases and log files, restore the
        backup and then run normal recovery — you must always run catastrophic
        recovery when using hot backups.
    </p>
      <p>
        If the database or log files have been destroyed or corrupted, or
        normal recovery fails, catastrophic recovery is required.  For example,
        catastrophic failure includes the case where the disk drive on which
        the database or log files are stored has been physically destroyed, or
        when the underlying filesystem is corrupted and the operating system's
        normal filesystem checking procedures cannot bring that filesystem to a
        consistent state.  This is often difficult to detect, and a common sign
        of the need for catastrophic recovery is when normal Berkeley DB
        recovery procedures fail, or when checksum errors are displayed during
        normal database procedures.  
    </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
            Berkeley DB backups (archives) can be recovered using machines
            of differing byte order. That is, a backup taken on a 
            big-endian machine can be used to restore a database residing 
            on a little-endian machine.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        When catastrophic recovery is necessary, take the following steps:
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                Restore the most recent snapshots of the database and log files from
                the backup media into the directory where recovery will be performed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                If any log files were archived since the last snapshot was made,
                they should be restored into the directory where recovery will be
                performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If any log files are available from the database environment that
                failed (for example, the disk holding the database files crashed,
                but the disk holding the log files is fine), those log files should
                be copied into the directory where recovery will be performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be sure to restore all log files in the order they were written.
                The order is important because it's possible the same log file
                appears on multiple backups, and you want to run recovery using the
                most recent version of each log file.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Run the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility, specifying its <span class="bold"><strong>-c</strong></span> option; or call the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;open()</a> method,
                specifying the <a href="../api_reference/C/envopen.html#envopen_DB_RECOVER_FATAL" class="olink">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> flag.  The catastrophic recovery
                process will review the logs and database files to bring the
                environment databases to a consistent state as of the time of the
                last uncorrupted log file that is found.  It is important to
                realize that only transactions committed before that date will
                appear in the databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to re-create the database in a location different
                from the original by specifying appropriate pathnames to the
                <span class="bold"><strong>-h</strong></span> option of the <a href="../api_reference/C/db_recover.html" class="olink">db_recover</a> utility. In
                order for this to work properly, it is important that your
                application refer to files by names relative to the database home
                directory or the pathname(s) specified in calls to
                <a href="../api_reference/C/envadd_data_dir.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;add_data_dir()</a>, instead of using full pathnames.
