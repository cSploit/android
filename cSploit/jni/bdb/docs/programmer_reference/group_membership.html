        A replication group is a collection of two or more database
        environments which are configured to replicate with one another.
        When operating normally, a replication group consists of a master
        site and one or more read-only sites.
    </p>
      <p>
        For Replication Manager applications, the sites comprising the
        replication group are recorded in an internal group
        membership database, so even if
        a group member is not available, it counts towards the group's
        total site count. This matters for certain replication activities,
        such as holding elections and acknowledging replication messages
        that require some number of sites to participate in these
        activities.  Replicated applications will often require all sites,
        or a majority of sites, to participate before the activity can be
        completed. 
    </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
            If you are configuring your application to keep replication
            metadata in-memory by specifying the <a href="../api_reference/C/repconfig.html#config_DB_REP_CONF_INMEM" class="olink">DB_REP_CONF_INMEM</a> flag to the
            <a href="../api_reference/C/repconfig.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_config()</a> method, then the internal group
            membership database is not stored persistently on disk. This
            severely limits Replication Manager's ability to automatically
            manage group membership. For more information, including some
            work-arounds, see
            <a class="xref" href="rep_filename.html" title="Managing replication directories and files">Managing replication directories and files</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Because Replication Manager tracks group members, there are some
        administrative activities that you should know about when using
        Berkeley DB replication. 
    </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

        <p>
            To add a site to a replication group, you merely start up the
            site such that it knows where at least one site in the group is
            located. The new site then joins the group. When this
            happens, the new site is recorded in the group membership database.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that when you are starting the very first site in the
            group for the very first time (called <span class="emphasis"><em>the primordial
                start up</em></span>), there are no other existing sites to
            help the new site join the group. In fact, a primordial start up
            actually creates the group.  For this reason, there are some
            slight differences on how to perform a primordial start up.  For
            a description of this, see
            <a class="xref" href="group_membership.html#group_mem_primordialstartup" title="Primordial startups">Primordial startups</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you add a site to a replication group, you use the
            following general procedure:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                    Make sure your replication group is operating well
                    enough that write activity can occur.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Create and open the environment such that it is configured to
                    use replication.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Use <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgr_site.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;repmgr_site()</a> to obtain a <a href="../api_reference/C/db_site.html" class="olink">DB_SITE</a> handle.
                    Configure this handle for the local site's host and
                    port information when you create the handle. Then, use
                    <a href="../api_reference/C/dbsite_set_config.html" class="olink">DB_SITE-&gt;set_config()</a> to indicate that this is the local
                    site by setting the <code class="literal">DB_LOCAL_SITE</code>
                    parameter.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Use <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgr_site.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;repmgr_site()</a> to obtain a second <a href="../api_reference/C/db_site.html" class="olink">DB_SITE</a> handle.
                    Configure this handle with the host and port
                    information for a site that already belongs to the
                    replication group. Then, use <a href="../api_reference/C/dbsite_set_config.html" class="olink">DB_SITE-&gt;set_config()</a> to
                    indicate this site is a "helper" site by setting the 
                    <code class="literal">DB_BOOTSTRAP_HELPER</code> parameter. By
                    configuring a <a href="../api_reference/C/db_site.html" class="olink">DB_SITE</a> handle in this way, your new
                    site will know how to contact the replication group so
                    that it can join the group.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Start replication as normal by configuring an
                    acknowledgement policy, setting the site's replication
                    priority, and then calling <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrstart.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;repmgr_start()</a>.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Note that on subsequent start-ups of your replication code, any
            helper site information you might provide is ignored because
            the Replication Manager reads the group membership database
            in order to obtain this information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, be aware that if the new site cannot be added to the
            group for some reason (because a master site is not available,
            or because insufficient replicas are running to acknowledge the
            new site), the attempt to start the new site via <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgrstart.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;repmgr_start()</a>
            will fail and return <code class="literal">DB_REP_UNAVAIL</code>. You can
            then pause and retry the start up attempt until it completes
            successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must use the exact same host string and port number to refer
            to a given site throughout your application and on each of its
            sites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Elections and message acknowledgements require knowledge of the
            total number of sites in the group. If a site is shut down, or
            is otherwise unable to communicate with the rest of the group,
            it still counts towards the total number of sites in the group.
            In most cases, this is the desirable behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you are shutting down a site permanently, then you
            should remove that site from the group. You might also want to
            remove a site from the group if you are shutting it down
            temporarily, but nevertheless for a very long period of time
            (days or weeks). In either case, you remove a site from the
            group by:

            <li>
              <p>
                    On one of the sites in your replication group (this
                    does not have to be the master site), use <a href="../api_reference/C/repmgr_site.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;repmgr_site()</a>
                    to obtain a <a href="../api_reference/C/db_site.html" class="olink">DB_SITE</a> handle. Configure this handle with
                    the host and port information of the site that you want
                    to remove. 
                </p>
              <p>
                    Note that this step can occur at any site —
                    including the site that you are removing from the
                    group.

                    Call the <a href="../api_reference/C/dbsite_remove.html" class="olink">DB_SITE-&gt;remove()</a> method. This removes the
                    identified site from the group membership database. If
                    this action is not performed on the master site, the
                    client sends a request to the master to perform the
                    operation and awaits confirmation.

              <p>
                    A client removing itself can close its database environment
                    any time after the DB_SITE-&gt;remove() method returns. A site
                    that has been removed by another site can close its database

            If you have never started a site in a replication group before,
            then the group membership database does not exist.
            In this situation, you must start an initial site and declare it to
            be the group creator. This causes the site to become the master,
            create the group membership database, and create a replication
            group of size 1. After that, subsequent sites can add
            themselves to the group  as described in

                It is never incorrect to declare a site the group creator.
                This is true even well-after the replication group has been
                established. This is because group creator information is
                ignored on any site start-up, except for the primoridial
                start-up; that is, a start-up where the group membership

            Prior to the Berkeley DB 11.2.5.2 release, replication group
            membership was managed differently than in the way it is
            described in the previous sections. For this reason, when you
            upgrade from older releases of Berkeley DB to 11.2.5.2 or
            later, the upgrade procedure is different than when upgrading
            between other releases.

            To perform an upgrade that takes you from the old way of

            membership (pre-11.2.5.2 to 11.2.5.2 and later), do the

                    handle and related methods. Recompile and thoroughly
                    test your code to make sure it is production-ready.

                            is a legacy site by setting the
                            <code class="literal">DB_LEGACY</code> parameter.

                            Please pay careful attention to this step. To
                            repeat: a <a href="../api_reference/C/db_site.html" class="olink">DB_SITE</a> handle MUST be configured
                            for EVERY site in the replication group.

                            Start replication. The site is upgraded at this
                            point.

              <p>
                    Once you have performed this procedure for each
                    production site, making sure to upgrade the master only
                    after every other site has been upgraded, you are done
                    upgrading your replicated application to use the
                    current group membership mechanism.

        <p>
            On subsequent restarts of your replication code, you do not
            need to specify the <code class="literal">DB_LEGACY</code> parameter, nor
            do you need to identify all of the replication group members.
            However, it is not an error if you do specify this information
            on subsequent start ups.
