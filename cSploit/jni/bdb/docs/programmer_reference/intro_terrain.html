      <p>The first step in selecting a database system is figuring out what the
choices are. Decades of research and real-world deployment have produced
countless systems. We need to organize them somehow to reduce the number
of options.</p>
      <p>One obvious way to group systems is to use the common labels that
vendors apply to them. The buzzwords here include "network,"
"relational," "object-oriented," and "embedded," with some
cross-fertilization like "object-relational" and "embedded network".
Understanding the buzzwords is important. Each has some grounding in
theory, but has also evolved into a practical label for categorizing
systems that work in a certain way.</p>
      <p>All database systems, regardless of the buzzwords that apply to them,
provide a few common services.  All of them store data, for example.
We'll begin by exploring the common services that all systems provide,
and then examine the differences among the different kinds of systems.</p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="idp88840"></a>Data access and data management</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Fundamentally, database systems provide two services.</p>
        <p>The first service is <span class="emphasis"><em>data access</em></span>. Data access means adding
new data to the database (inserting), finding data of interest
(searching), changing data already stored (updating), and removing data
from the database (deleting). All databases provide these services. How
they work varies from category to category, and depends on the record
structure that the database supports.</p>
        <p>Each record in a database is a collection of values. For example, the
record for a Web site customer might include a name, email address,
shipping address, and payment information. Records are usually stored
in tables.  Each table holds records of the same kind. For example, the
<span class="bold"><strong>customer</strong></span> table at an e-commerce Web site might store the
customer records for every person who shopped at the site. Often,
database records have a different structure from the structures or
instances supported by the programming language in which an application
is written. As a result, working with records can mean:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>using database operations like searches and updates on records; and</li>
            <li>converting between programming language structures and database record
types in the application.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The second service is <span class="emphasis"><em>data management</em></span>. Data management is
more complicated than data access. Providing good data management
services is the hard part of building a database system.  When you
choose a database system to use in an application you build, making sure
it supports the data management services you need is critical.</p>
        <p>Data management services include allowing multiple users to work on the
database simultaneously (concurrency), allowing multiple records to be
changed instantaneously (transactions), and surviving application and
system crashes (recovery). Different database systems offer different
data management services.  Data management services are entirely
independent of the data access services listed above. For example,
nothing about relational database theory requires that the system
support transactions, but most commercial relational systems do.</p>
        <p>Concurrency means that multiple users can operate on the database at
the same time. Support for concurrency ranges from none (single-user
access only) to complete (many readers and writers working
simultaneously).</p>
        <p>Transactions permit users to make multiple changes appear at once.  For
example, a transfer of funds between bank accounts needs to be a
transaction because the balance in one account is reduced and the
balance in the other increases. If the reduction happened before the
increase, than a poorly-timed system crash could leave the customer
poorer; if the bank used the opposite order, then the same system crash
could make the customer richer. Obviously, both the customer and the
bank are best served if both operations happen at the same instant.</p>
        <p>Transactions have well-defined properties in database systems. They are
<span class="emphasis"><em>atomic</em></span>, so that the changes happen all at once or not at all.
They are <span class="emphasis"><em>consistent</em></span>, so that the database is in a legal state
when the transaction begins and when it ends. They are typically
<span class="emphasis"><em>isolated</em></span>, which means that any other users in the database
cannot interfere with them while they are in progress. And they are
<span class="emphasis"><em>durable</em></span>, so that if the system or application crashes after
a transaction finishes, the changes are not lost. Together, the
properties of <span class="emphasis"><em>atomicity</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>consistency</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>isolation</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>durability</em></span> are known as the ACID
properties.</p>
        <p>As is the case for concurrency, support for transactions varies among
databases. Some offer atomicity without making guarantees about
durability.  Some ignore isolatability, especially in single-user
systems; there's no need to isolate other users from the effects of
changes when there are no other users.</p>
        <p>Another important data management service is recovery. Strictly
speaking, recovery is a procedure that the system carries out when it
starts up. The purpose of recovery is to guarantee that the database is
complete and usable. This is most important after a system or
application crash, when the database may have been damaged. The recovery
process guarantees that the internal structure of the database is good.
Recovery usually means that any completed transactions are checked, and
any lost changes are reapplied to the database.  At the end of the
recovery process, applications can use the database as if there had been
no interruption in service.</p>
        <p>Finally, there are a number of data management services that permit
copying of data. For example, most database systems are able to import
data from other sources, and to export it for use elsewhere.  Also, most
systems provide some way to back up databases and to restore in the
event of a system failure that damages the database. Many commercial
systems allow <span class="emphasis"><em>hot backups</em></span>, so that users can back up
databases while they are in use. Many applications must run without
interruption, and cannot be shut down for backups.</p>
        <p>A particular database system may provide other data management services.
Some provide browsers that show database structure and contents. Some
include tools that enforce data integrity rules, such as the rule that
no employee can have a negative salary.  These data management services
are not common to all systems, however. Concurrency, recovery, and
transactions are the data management services that most database vendors
support.</p>
        <p>Deciding what kind of database to use means understanding the data
access and data management services that your application needs.  Berkeley DB
is an embedded database that supports fairly simple data access with a
rich set of data management services. To highlight its strengths and
weaknesses, we can compare it to other database system categories.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Relational databases are probably the best-known database variant,
because of the success of companies like Oracle. Relational databases
are based on the mathematical field of set theory.  The term "relation"
is really just a synonym for "set" -- a relation is just a set of
records or, in our terminology, a table. One of the main innovations in
early relational systems was to insulate the programmer from the
physical organization of the database. Rather than walking through
arrays of records or traversing pointers, programmers make statements
about tables in a high-level language, and the system executes those
statements.</p>
        <p>Relational databases operate on <span class="emphasis"><em>tuples</em></span>, or records, composed
of values of several different data types, including integers, character
strings, and others. Operations include searching for records whose
values satisfy some criteria, updating records, and so on.</p>
        <p>Virtually all relational databases use the Structured Query Language,
or SQL. This language permits people and computer programs to work with
the database by writing simple statements. The database engine reads
those statements and determines how to satisfy them on the tables in
the database.</p>
        <p>SQL is the main practical advantage of relational database systems.
Rather than writing a computer program to find records of interest, the
relational system user can just type a query in a simple syntax, and
let the engine do the work. This gives users enormous flexibility; they
do not need to decide in advance what kind of searches they want to do,
and they do not need expensive programmers to find the data they need.
Learning SQL requires some effort, but it's much simpler than a
full-blown high-level programming language for most purposes. And there
are a lot of programmers who have already learned SQL.</p>

      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Object-oriented databases are less common than relational systems, but
are still fairly widespread. Most object-oriented databases were
originally conceived as persistent storage systems closely wedded to
particular high-level programming languages like C++. With the spread
of Java, most now support more than one programming language, but
object-oriented database systems fundamentally provide the same class
and method abstractions as do object-oriented programming languages.</p>
        <p>Many object-oriented systems allow applications to operate on objects
uniformly, whether they are in memory or on disk. These systems create
the illusion that all objects are in memory all the time.  The advantage
to object-oriented programmers who simply want object storage and
retrieval is clear. They need never be aware of whether an object is in
memory or not.  The application simply uses objects, and the database
system moves them between disk and memory transparently.  All of the
operations on an object, and all its behavior, are determined by the
programming language.</p>
        <p>Object-oriented databases aren't nearly as widely deployed as relational
systems. In order to attract developers who understand relational
systems, many of the object-oriented systems have added support for
query languages very much like SQL. In practice, though, object-oriented
databases are mostly used for persistent storage of objects in C++ and
Java programs.</p>

              <h3 class="title"><a id="idp131120"></a>Network databases</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The "network model" is a fairly old technique for managing and
navigating application data. Network databases are designed to make
pointer traversal very fast. Every record stored in a network database
is allowed to contain pointers to other records. These pointers are
generally physical addresses, so fetching the record to which it refers
just means reading it from disk by its disk address.</p>
        <p>Network database systems generally permit records to contain integers,
floating point numbers, and character strings, as well as references to
other records. An application can search for records of interest. After
retrieving a record, the application can fetch any record to which it
refers, quickly.</p>
        <p>Pointer traversal is fast because most network systems use physical disk
addresses as pointers. When the application wants to fetch a record,
the database system uses the address to fetch exactly the right string
of bytes from the disk. This requires only a single disk access in all
cases. Other systems, by contrast, often must do more than one disk read
to find a particular record.</p>
        <p>The key advantage of the network model is also its main drawback. The
fact that pointer traversal is so fast means that applications that do
it will run well. On the other hand, storing pointers all over the
database makes it very hard to reorganize the database. In effect, once
you store a pointer to a record, it is difficult to move that record
elsewhere.  Some network databases handle this by leaving forwarding
pointers behind, but this defeats the speed advantage of doing a single
disk access in the first place. Other network databases find, and fix,
all the pointers to a record when it moves, but this makes
reorganization very expensive. Reorganization is often necessary in
databases, since adding and deleting records over time will consume
space that cannot be reclaimed without reorganizing. Without periodic
reorganization to compact network databases, they can end up with a
considerable amount of wasted space.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Database vendors have two choices for system architecture. They can
build a server to which remote clients connect, and do all the database
management inside the server. Alternatively, they can provide a module
that links directly into the application, and does all database
management locally.  In either case, the application developer needs
some way of communicating with the database (generally, an Application
Programming Interface (API) that does work in the process or that
communicates with a server to get work done).</p>
        <p>Almost all commercial database products are implemented as servers, and
applications connect to them as clients. Servers have several features
that make them attractive.</p>
        <p>First, because all of the data is managed by a separate process, and
possibly on a separate machine, it's easy to isolate the database server
from bugs and crashes in the application.</p>
        <p>Second, because some database products (particularly relational engines)
are quite large, splitting them off as separate server processes keeps
applications small, which uses less disk space and memory. Relational
engines include code to parse SQL statements, to analyze them and
produce plans for execution, to optimize the plans, and to execute
them.</p>
        <p>Finally, by storing all the data in one place and managing it with a
single server, it's easier for organizations to back up, protect, and
set policies on their databases. The enterprise databases for large
companies often have several full-time administrators caring for them,
making certain that applications run quickly, granting and denying
access to users, and making backups.</p>
        <p>However, centralized administration can be a disadvantage in some cases.
In particular, if a programmer wants to build an application that uses
a database for storage of important information, then shipping and
supporting the application is much harder. The end user needs to install
and administer a separate database server, and the programmer must
support not just one product, but two. Adding a server process to the
application creates new opportunity for installation mistakes and
run-time problems.</p>
