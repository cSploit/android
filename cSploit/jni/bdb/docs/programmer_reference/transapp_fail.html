      <p>
    When building Transactional Data Store applications, there are design
    issues to consider whenever a thread of control with open Berkeley DB
    handles fails for any reason (where a thread of control may be either a
    true thread or a process).
</p>
      <p>
    The first case is handling system failure: if the system fails, the
    database environment and the databases may be left in a corrupted
    state.  In this case, recovery must be performed on the database
    environment before any further action is taken, in order to:
</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>recover the database environment resources,</li>
          <li>release any locks or mutexes that may have been held to avoid starvation
as the remaining threads of control convoy behind the held locks, and</li>
          <li>resolve any partially completed operations that may have left a database
in an inconsistent or corrupted state.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
    For details on performing recovery, see the 
    <a class="xref" href="transapp_recovery.html" title="Recovery procedures">Recovery procedures</a>.
</p>
      <p>
    The second case is handling the failure of a thread of control.  There
    are resources maintained in database environments that may be left
    locked or corrupted if a thread of control exits unexpectedly.  These
    resources include data structure mutexes, logical database locks and
    unresolved transactions (that is, transactions which were never aborted
    or committed).  While Transactional Data Store applications can treat
    the failure of a thread of control in the same way as they do a system
    failure, they have an alternative choice, the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> method.
</p>
      <p>
    The <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> will return 
    <a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> 
    if the database
    environment is unusable as a result of the thread of control failure.
    (If a data structure mutex or a database write lock is left held by
    thread of control failure, the application should not continue to use
    the database environment, as subsequent use of the environment is
    likely to result in threads of control convoying behind the held
    locks.)  The <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> call will release any database read locks
    that have been left held by the exit of a thread of control, and abort
    any unresolved transactions.  In this case, the application can
    continue to use the database environment.
</p>
      <p>
    A Transactional Data Store application recovering from a thread of
    control failure should call <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a>, and, if it returns success,
    the application can continue.  If <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> returns
    <a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>, 
    the application should proceed as described for
    the case of system failure.
</p>
      <p>
    It greatly simplifies matters that recovery may be performed regardless
    of whether recovery needs to be performed; that is, it is not an error
    to recover a database environment for which recovery is not strictly
    necessary.  For this reason, applications should not try to determine
    if the database environment was active when the application or system
    failed.  Instead, applications should run recovery any time the
    <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> method returns 
    <a class="link" href="program_errorret.html#program_errorret.DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a>,
    or, if the application is
    not calling the <a href="../api_reference/C/envfailchk.html" class="olink">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</a> method, any time any thread of control
    accessing the database environment fails, as well as any time the
    system reboots.
