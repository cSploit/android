This directory contains a sql source file called sample.sql.  To use
db_sql to translate this schema into C code implementing a Berkeley DB
storage layer, issue the following command:

  db_sql -i sample.sql -t sample_test.c

This will produce three files: sample.h, sample.c, and sample_test.c.

The generated program includes, in sample_test.c, a main function to
exercise the new storage layer.  To build the program, compile the two
.c source files and link them together with the Berkeley DB runtime
library.  On Unix, this command would typically be somethin like:

cc -g -I$BDB_INSTALL/include -L$BDB_INSTALL/lib -o sample sample.c sample_test.c -ldb-4.8 -lpthread

On Windows, you could use Visual Studio to create a project containing
these files.

Once the program is built, you can run it with no arguments.  The
program generated from sample.sql will create a database environment
in a directory named "numismatics."  This directory must be created
before the program is run.
