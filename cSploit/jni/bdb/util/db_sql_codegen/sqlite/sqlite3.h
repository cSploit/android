**
** The "version" of SQLite is a string of the form "X.Y.Z".
** The phrase "alpha" or "beta" might be appended after the Z.
** The X value is major version number always 3 in SQLite3.
** The X value only changes when  backwards compatibility is
** broken and we intend to never break
** backwards compatibility.  The Y value is the minor version
** number and only changes when
** there are major feature enhancements that are forwards compatible
** but not backwards compatible.  The Z value is release number
** and is incremented with
** each release but resets back to 0 when Y is incremented.

** CAPI3REF: One-Step Query Execution Interface {F12100}
**
** The sqlite3_exec() interface is a convenient way of running
** one or more SQL statements without a lot of C code.  The
** SQL statements are passed in as the second parameter to
** sqlite3_exec().  The statements are evaluated one by one
** until either an error or an interrupt is encountered or
** until they are all done.  The 3rd parameter is an optional
** callback that is invoked once for each row of any query results
** produced by the SQL statements.  The 5th parameter tells where
** to write any error messages.
**
** The sqlite3_exec() interface is implemented in terms of
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()].
** The sqlite3_exec() routine does nothing that cannot be done
** by [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()].

**          zero-terminated string of its 2nd parameter within the
**          context of the [sqlite3] object given in the 1st parameter.
**
** {F12104} The return value of [sqlite3_exec()] is SQLITE_OK if all
**          SQL statements run successfully.
**
** {F12105} The return value of [sqlite3_exec()] is an appropriate 
**          non-zero error code if any SQL statement fails.
**
** {F12107} If one or more of the SQL statements handed to [sqlite3_exec()]
**          return results and the 3rd parameter is not NULL, then
**          the callback function specified by the 3rd parameter is
**          invoked once for each row of result.
**
** {F12110} If the callback returns a non-zero value then [sqlite3_exec()]
**          will aborted the SQL statement it is currently evaluating,
**          skip all subsequent SQL statements, and return [SQLITE_ABORT].
**          <todo>What happens to *errmsg here?  Does the result code for
**          sqlite3_errcode() get set?</todo>
**
** {F12113} The [sqlite3_exec()] routine will pass its 4th parameter through
**          as the 1st parameter of the callback.
**
** {F12116} The [sqlite3_exec()] routine sets the 2nd parameter of its
**          callback to be the number of columns in the current row of
**          result.
**
** {F12119} The [sqlite3_exec()] routine sets the 3rd parameter of its 
**          callback to be an array of pointers to strings holding the
**          values for each column in the current result set row as
**          obtained from [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** {F12122} The [sqlite3_exec()] routine sets the 4th parameter of its
**          callback to be an array of pointers to strings holding the
**          names of result columns as obtained from [sqlite3_column_name()].
**
** {F12125} If the 3rd parameter to [sqlite3_exec()] is NULL then
**          [sqlite3_exec()] never invokes a callback.  All query
**          results are silently discarded.
**
** {F12128} If an error occurs while parsing or evaluating any of the SQL
**          statements handed to [sqlite3_exec()] then [sqlite3_exec()] will
**          return an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
**
** {F12131} If an error occurs while parsing or evaluating any of the SQL
**          handed to [sqlite3_exec()] and if the 5th parameter (errmsg)
**          to [sqlite3_exec()] is not NULL, then an error message is
**          allocated using the equivalent of [sqlite3_mprintf()] and
**          *errmsg is made to point to that message.
**
** {F12134} The [sqlite3_exec()] routine does not change the value of
**          *errmsg if errmsg is NULL or if there are no errors.
**
** {F12137} The [sqlite3_exec()] function sets the error code and message
**          accessible via [sqlite3_errcode()], [sqlite3_errmsg()], and
**          [sqlite3_errmsg16()].
**
** LIMITATIONS:
**

** {U12143} The calling function is should use [sqlite3_free()] to free
**          the memory that *errmsg is left pointing at once the error
**          message is no longer needed.
**
** {U12145} The SQL statement text in the 2nd parameter to [sqlite3_exec()]
**          must remain unchanged while [sqlite3_exec()] is running.

** methods used to perform various operations against the open file.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
*  The second choice is an
** OS-X style fullsync.  The SQLITE_SYNC_DATA flag may be ORed in to
** indicate that only the data of the file and not its inode needs to be
** synced.
** 
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
** </ul>
** xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.  
** The xCheckReservedLock() method looks
** to see if any database connection, either in this
** process or in some other process, is holding an RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
** if such a lock exists and false if not.
** 
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument
** is an integer opcode.   The third
** argument is a generic pointer which is intended to be a pointer
** to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves opcodes less than 100 for its own use. 
** A [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
** Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes 
** greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
** device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
** underlying device:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC1K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC2K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC4K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC8K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC16K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC32K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC64K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL]
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
** any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
** mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
** are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
** nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
** that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
** first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
** way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
** information is written to disk in the same order as calls
** to xWrite().

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object {F11140}
**
** An instance of this object defines the interface between the
** SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".
**
** The iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger for future
** versions of SQLite.  Additional fields may be appended to this
** object when the iVersion value is increased.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs 
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** {F11141} SQLite will guarantee that the zFilename string passed to
** xOpen() is a full pathname as generated by xFullPathname() and
** that the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called.  {END} So the [sqlite3_file] can store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
**
** {F11142} The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]. {END}
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be
** set.
** 
** {F11143} SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
** 
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MASTER_JOURNAL]
** </ul> {END}
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** changes the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return 
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database 
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random 
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
** 
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen
** method:
** 
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
** 
** {F11145} The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  {F11146} The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP  databases, journals and for subjournals. 
** {F11147} The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag means the file should be opened
** for exclusive access.  This flag is set for all files except
** for the main database file. {END}
** 
** {F11148} At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite 
** to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third 
** argument to xOpen.  {END}  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.
** 
** {F11149} The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS] 
** to test for the existance of a file,
** or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to test to see
** if a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test to see if a file is at least readable.  {END} The file can be a 
** directory.
** 
** {F11150} SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for
** the output buffers for xGetTempname and xFullPathname. {F11151} The exact
** size of the output buffer is also passed as a parameter to both 
** methods. {END} If the output buffer is not large enough, SQLITE_CANTOPEN
** should be returned. As this is handled as a fatal error by SQLite,
** vfs implementations should endeavor to prevent this by setting 
** mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
** 
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), and xCurrentTime() interfaces
** are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.  The
** xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and
** time.

** CAPI3REF: Register A Callback To Handle SQLITE_BUSY Errors {F12310}
**
** This routine identifies a callback function that might be
** invoked whenever an attempt is made to open a database table 
** that another thread or process has locked.
** If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY]
** or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** is returned immediately upon encountering the lock.
** If the busy callback is not NULL, then the
** callback will be invoked with two arguments.  The
** first argument to the handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
** is the third argument to this routine.  The second argument to
** the handler is the number of times that the busy handler has
** been invoked for this locking event.   If the
** busy callback returns 0, then no additional attempts are made to
** access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] is returned.
** If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt
** is made to open the database for reading and the cycle repeats.
**
** The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that
** it will be invoked when there is lock contention.
** If SQLite determines that invoking the busy handler could result in
** a deadlock, it will go ahead and return [SQLITE_BUSY] or
** [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] instead of invoking the
** busy handler.
** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
** it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
** a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
** to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
** because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot
** proceed because it is blocked by the first.  If both processes
** invoke the busy handlers, neither will make any progress.  Therefore,
** SQLite returns [SQLITE_BUSY] for the first process, hoping that this
** will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
** the second process to proceed.
**
** The default busy callback is NULL.
**
** The [SQLITE_BUSY] error is converted to [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** when SQLite is in the middle of a large transaction where all the
** changes will not fit into the in-memory cache.  SQLite will
** already hold a RESERVED lock on the database file, but it needs
** to promote this lock to EXCLUSIVE so that it can spill cache
** pages into the database file without harm to concurrent
** readers.  If it is unable to promote the lock, then the in-memory
** cache will be left in an inconsistent state and so the error
** code is promoted from the relatively benign [SQLITE_BUSY] to
** the more severe [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED].  This error code promotion
** forces an automatic rollback of the changes.  See the
** <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=CorruptionFollowingBusyError">
** CorruptionFollowingBusyError</a> wiki page for a discussion of why
** this is important.
**

** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries {F12370}
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated
** UTF-8 strings.  There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  
** The first M pointers point to zero-terminated strings that 
** contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL
** values are give a NULL pointer.  All other values are in
** their UTF-8 zero-terminated string representation as returned by
** [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consists of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two column (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
** result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
** in an array names azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
**        azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
**        azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
**        azResult&#91;3] = "43";
**        azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
**        azResult&#91;5] = "28";
**        azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult&#91;7] = "21";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
** semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
** string of its 2nd parameter.  It returns a result table to the
** pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
**
** After the calling function has finished using the result, it should 
** pass the pointer to the result table to sqlite3_free_table() in order to 
** release the memory that was malloc-ed.  Because of the way the 
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
** function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only 
** [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around
** [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
** to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
** interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the
** wrapper layer outside of the internal [sqlite3_exec()] call are not
** reflected in subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] or
** [sqlite3_errmsg()].
**
** INVARIANTS:
**
** {F12371} If a [sqlite3_get_table()] fails a memory allocation, then
**          it frees the result table under construction, aborts the
**          query in process, skips any subsequent queries, sets the
**          *resultp output pointer to NULL and returns [SQLITE_NOMEM].
**
** {F12373} If the ncolumn parameter to [sqlite3_get_table()] is not NULL
**          then [sqlite3_get_table()] write the number of columns in the

** CAPI3REF: Formatted String Printing Functions {F17400}
**
** These routines are workalikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite3_free()].   Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** In sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter. Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a null-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, so some string variable contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you
** should always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string 
** literal.
**
** The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Or if the parameter in the argument
** list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without single
** quotes) in place of the %Q option. {END}  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** The "%z" formatting option works exactly like "%s" with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite3_free()] is called on the input string. {END}
**
** INVARIANTS:
**
** {F17403}  The [sqlite3_mprintf()] and [sqlite3_vmprintf()] interfaces

** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Subsystem {F17300}
**
** The SQLite core  uses these three routines for all of its own
** internal memory allocation needs. "Core" in the previous sentence
** does not include operating-system specific VFS implementation.  The
** windows VFS uses native malloc and free for some operations.
**
** The sqlite3_malloc() routine returns a pointer to a block
** of memory at least N bytes in length, where N is the parameter.
** If sqlite3_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free
** memory, it returns a NULL pointer.  If the parameter N to
** sqlite3_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite3_malloc() returns
** a NULL pointer.
**
** Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so
** that it might be reused.  The sqlite3_free() routine is
** a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
** to sqlite3_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
** should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
** memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_free().
**
** The sqlite3_realloc() interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation to be at least N bytes, where N is the
** second parameter.  The memory allocation to be resized is the first
** parameter.  If the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc()
** is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
** sqlite3_malloc(N) where N is the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** If the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc() is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite3_free(P) where P is the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** Sqlite3_realloc() returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if sufficient memory is unavailable.
** If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
** of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
** by sqlite3_realloc() and the prior allocation is freed.
** If sqlite3_realloc() returns NULL, then the prior allocation
** is not freed.
**

**
** In SQLite version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1, it was possible to define

** return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.   If the authorizer callback returns
** any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]

/*
** CAPI3REF: Opening A New Database Connection {F12700}
**
** These routines open an SQLite database file whose name
** is given by the filename argument.
** The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8
** for [sqlite3_open()] and [sqlite3_open_v2()] and as UTF-16
** in the native byte order for [sqlite3_open16()].
** An [sqlite3*] handle is usually returned in *ppDb, even
** if an error occurs.  The only exception is if SQLite is unable
** to allocate memory to hold the [sqlite3] object, a NULL will
** be written into *ppDb instead of a pointer to the [sqlite3] object.
** If the database is opened (and/or created)
** successfully, then [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an
** error code is returned.  The
** [sqlite3_errmsg()] or [sqlite3_errmsg16()]  routines can be used to obtain
** an English language description of the error.
**
** The default encoding for the database will be UTF-8 if
** [sqlite3_open()] or [sqlite3_open_v2()] is called and
** UTF-16 in the native byte order if [sqlite3_open16()] is used.
**
** Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources
** associated with the [sqlite3*] handle should be released by passing it
** to [sqlite3_close()] when it is no longer required.
**
** The [sqlite3_open_v2()] interface works like [sqlite3_open()] 
** except that it acccepts two additional parameters for additional control
** over the new database connection.  The flags parameter can be
** one of:
**
** <ol>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]
** </ol>
**
** The first value opens the database read-only. 
** If the database does not previously exist, an error is returned.
** The second option opens
** the database for reading and writing if possible, or reading only if
** if the file is write protected.  In either case the database
** must already exist or an error is returned.  The third option
** opens the database for reading and writing and creates it if it does
** not already exist.
** The third options is behavior that is always used for [sqlite3_open()]
** and [sqlite3_open16()].
**
** If the 3rd parameter to [sqlite3_open_v2()] is not one of the
** combinations shown above then the behavior is undefined.
**
** If the filename is ":memory:", then an private
** in-memory database is created for the connection.  This in-memory
** database will vanish when the database connection is closed.  Future
** version of SQLite might make use of additional special filenames
** that begin with the ":" character.  It is recommended that 
** when a database filename really does begin with
** ":" that you prefix the filename with a pathname like "./" to
** avoid ambiguity.
**
** If the filename is an empty string, then a private temporary
** on-disk database will be created.  This private database will be
** automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.
**
** The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
** [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system 
** interface that the new database connection should use.  If the
** fourth parameter is a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3_vfs]
** object is used.
**
** <b>Note to windows users:</b>  The encoding used for the filename argument
** of [sqlite3_open()] and [sqlite3_open_v2()] must be UTF-8, not whatever

** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement {F13010}
**
** To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines. 
**
** The first argument "db" is an [database connection] 
** obtained from a prior call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()]. 
** The second argument "zSql" is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
** interfaces uses UTF-8 and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16. {END}
**
** If the nByte argument is less
** than zero, then zSql is read up to the first zero terminator.
** If nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum number of 
** bytes read from zSql.  When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' or '\u0000' character or 
** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be had by passing an nByte parameter that 
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i> 
** the nul-terminator bytes.{END}
**
** *pzTail is made to point to the first byte past the end of the
** first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only compiles the first
** statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to what remains
** uncompiled.
**
** *ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  Or if there is an error, *ppStmt is
** set to NULL.  If the input text contains no SQL (if the input
** is and empty string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** {U13018} The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the
** compiled SQL statement
** using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
**
** On success, [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an 
** [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
** recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained
** for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the 
** original SQL text. {END} This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave a differently in two ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again.  If the schema has changed in
** a way that makes the statement no longer valid, [sqlite3_step()] will still
** return [SQLITE_SCHEMA].  But unlike the legacy behavior, 
** [SQLITE_SCHEMA] is now a fatal error.  Calling
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] again will not make the
** error go away.  Note: use [sqlite3_errmsg()] to find the text
** of the parsing error that results in an [SQLITE_SCHEMA] return. {END}
** </li>
**
** <li>
** When an error occurs, 
** [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed 
** [error codes] or [extended error codes]. 
** The legacy behavior was that [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic
** [SQLITE_ERROR] result code and you would have to make a second call to
** [sqlite3_reset()] in order to find the underlying cause of the problem.
** With the "v2" prepare interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is
** returned immediately.
** </li>
** </ol>

** SQLite uses dynamic typing for the values it stores.  
** Values stored in sqlite3_value objects can be
** be integers, floating point values, strings, BLOBs, or NULL.
**
** An sqlite3_value object may be either "protected" or "unprotected".
** Some interfaces require a protected sqlite3_value.  Other interfaces
** will accept either a protected or an unprotected sqlite3_value.
** Every interface that accepts sqlite3_value arguments specifies 
** whether or not it requires a protected sqlite3_value.
**
** The terms "protected" and "unprotected" refer to whether or not
** a mutex is held.  A internal mutex is held for a protected
** sqlite3_value object but no mutex is held for an unprotected
** sqlite3_value object.  If SQLite is compiled to be single-threaded
** (with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0 and with [sqlite3_threadsafe()] returning 0)
** then there is no distinction between

/*
** CAPI3REF:  Binding Values To Prepared Statements {F13500}
**
** In the SQL strings input to [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and its
** variants, literals may be replace by a parameter in one
** of these forms:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  ?
** <li>  ?NNN
** <li>  :VVV
** <li>  @VVV
** <li>  $VVV
** </ul>
**
** In the parameter forms shown above NNN is an integer literal,
** VVV alpha-numeric parameter name.
** The values of these parameters (also called "host parameter names"
** or "SQL parameters")
** can be set using the sqlite3_bind_*() routines defined here.
**
** The first argument to the sqlite3_bind_*() routines always
** is a pointer to the [sqlite3_stmt] object returned from
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or its variants. The second
** argument is the index of the parameter to be set. The
** first parameter has an index of 1.  When the same named
** parameter is used more than once, second and subsequent
** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence. 
** The index for named parameters can be looked up using the
** [sqlite3_bind_parameter_name()] API if desired.  The index
** for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
** The NNN value must be between 1 and the compile-time
** parameter SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER (default value: 999).
**
** The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
**
** In those
** routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the number of bytes
** in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the number of <u>bytes</u>
** in the value, not the number of characters. 
** If the fourth parameter is negative, the length of the string is
** number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
**
** The fifth argument to sqlite3_bind_blob(), sqlite3_bind_text(), and
** sqlite3_bind_text16() is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or
** string after SQLite has finished with it. If the fifth argument is
** the special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
** information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
** If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then
** SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
** the sqlite3_bind_*() routine returns.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length N that
** is filled with zeros.  A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
** (just an integer to hold it size) while it is being processed.
** Zeroblobs are intended to serve as place-holders for BLOBs whose
** content is later written using 
** [sqlite3_blob_open | increment BLOB I/O] routines. A negative
** value for the zeroblob results in a zero-length BLOB.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_*() routines must be called after
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] (and its variants) or [sqlite3_reset()] and
** before [sqlite3_step()].
** Bindings are not cleared by the [sqlite3_reset()] routine.
** Unbound parameters are interpreted as NULL.
**
** These routines return [SQLITE_OK] on success or an error code if
** anything goes wrong.  [SQLITE_RANGE] is returned if the parameter
** index is out of range.  [SQLITE_NOMEM] is returned if malloc fails.
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] might be returned if these routines are called on a
** virtual machine that is the wrong state or which has already been finalized.
** Detection of misuse is unreliable.  Applications should not depend
** on SQLITE_MISUSE returns.  SQLITE_MISUSE is intended to indicate a
** a logic error in the application.  Future versions of SQLite might
** panic rather than return SQLITE_MISUSE.

** the legacy interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] or [sqlite3_prepare16()],
** then this function must be called one or more times to evaluate the 
** statement.
**
** The details of the behavior of this sqlite3_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "v2" interface
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interface [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "v2" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.
**
** In the legacy interface, the return value will be either [SQLITE_BUSY], 
** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** With the "v2" interface, any of the other [SQLITE_OK | result code]
** or [SQLITE_IOERR_READ | extended result code] might be returned as
** well.
**
** [SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  If the statement is a COMMIT
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a COMMIT and occurs within a
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** [SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then 
** [SQLITE_ROW] is returned each time a new row of data is ready
** for processing by the caller. The values may be accessed using
** the [sqlite3_column_int | column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
** 
** [SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (example:
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had 
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b>
** In the legacy interface, 
** the sqlite3_step() API always returns a generic error code,
** [SQLITE_ERROR], following any error other than [SQLITE_BUSY]
** and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the specific
** [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()], then the 
** more specific [error codes] are returned directly
** by sqlite3_step().  The use of the "v2" interface is recommended.

** has an index of 0.
**
** If the SQL statement is not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** the column index is out of range, the result is undefined. 
** These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
** [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
** [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] has been call subsequently.
** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or

** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
** are called from a different thread while any of these routines
** are pending, then the results are undefined.  
**
** The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns 
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].  The value
** returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no type
** conversions have occurred as described below.  After a type conversion,
** the value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is undefined.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes() 
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** The value returned does not include the zero terminator at the end
** of the string.  For clarity: the value returned is the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
** even empty strings, are always zero terminated.  The return
** value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length blob is an arbitrary
** pointer, possibly even a NULL pointer.
**
** The sqlite3_column_bytes16() routine is similar to sqlite3_column_bytes()
** but leaves the result in UTF-16 in native byte order instead of UTF-8.  
** The zero terminator is not included in this count.
**
** The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  An unprotected sqlite3_value object
** may only be used with [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].

** to routines like 
** [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or [sqlite3_value_bytes()],
** then the behavior is undefined.
**
** These routines attempt to convert the value where appropriate.  For
** example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result

** automatically.  The following table details the conversions that

**
** The table above makes reference to standard C library functions atoi()
** and atof().  SQLite does not really use these functions.  It has its
** on equavalent internal routines.  The atoi() and atof() names are
** used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most
** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated. 
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li><p>  The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() 
**          or sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**          need to be added to the string.</p></li>
**
** <li><p>  The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**          sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**          to UTF-16.</p></li>
**
** <li><p>  The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**          sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**          to UTF-8.</p></li>
** </ul>
**
** Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer points to will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometime it is
** not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.  
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
**  <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
**  </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(), sqlite3_column_blob(),
** or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result into the desired
** format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or sqlite3_column_bytes16() to
** find the size of the result.  Do not mix call to sqlite3_column_text() or
** sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes16().  And do not
** mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
**
** The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as
** described above, or until [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] is called.  The memory space used to hold strings
** and blobs is freed automatically.  Do <b>not</b> pass the pointers returned
** [sqlite3_column_blob()], [sqlite3_column_text()], etc. into 
** [sqlite3_free()].
**
** If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any
** of these routines, a default value is returned.  The default value
** is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL
** pointer.  Subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] will return
** [SQLITE_NOMEM].

** CAPI3REF: Create Or Redefine SQL Functions {F16100}
** KEYWORDS: {function creation routines} 
**
** These two functions (collectively known as
** "function creation routines") are used to add SQL functions or aggregates
** or to redefine the behavior of existing SQL functions or aggregates.  The
** difference only between the two is that the second parameter, the
** name of the (scalar) function or aggregate, is encoded in UTF-8 for
** sqlite3_create_function() and UTF-16 for sqlite3_create_function16().
**
** The first parameter is the [database connection] to which the SQL
** function is to be added.  If a single
** program uses more than one [database connection] internally, then SQL
** functions must be added individually to each [database connection].
**
** The second parameter is the name of the SQL function to be created
** or redefined.
** The length of the name is limited to 255 bytes, exclusive of the 
** zero-terminator.  Note that the name length limit is in bytes, not
** characters.  Any attempt to create a function with a longer name
** will result in an SQLITE_ERROR error.
**
** The third parameter is the number of arguments that the SQL function or
** aggregate takes. If this parameter is negative, then the SQL function or
** aggregate may take any number of arguments.
**
** The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what 
** [SQLITE_UTF8 | text encoding] this SQL function prefers for
** its parameters.  Any SQL function implementation should be able to work
** work with UTF-8, UTF-16le, or UTF-16be.  But some implementations may be
** more efficient with one encoding than another.  It is allowed to
** invoke sqlite3_create_function() or sqlite3_create_function16() multiple
** times with the same function but with different values of eTextRep.
** When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
** will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.
** If there is only a single implementation which does not care what
** text encoding is used, then the fourth argument should be
** [SQLITE_ANY].
**
** The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation
** of the function can gain access to this pointer using
** [sqlite3_user_data()].
**
** The seventh, eighth and ninth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
** pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL
** function or aggregate. A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of
** the xFunc callback only, NULL pointers should be passed as the xStep
** and xFinal parameters. An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation
** of xStep and xFinal and NULL should be passed for xFunc. To delete an
** existing SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL for all three function
** callback.
**
** It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing perferred text encodings.  SQLite will use
** the implementation most closely matches the way in which the
** SQL function is used.
**
** INVARIANTS:
**
** {F16103} The [sqlite3_create_function16()] interface behaves exactly
**          like [sqlite3_create_function()] in every way except that it

**          and having a perferred text encoding of E.
**
** {F16109} A successful call to [sqlite3_create_function(D,X,N,E,P,F,S,L)]
**          replaces the P, F, S, and L values from any prior calls with
**          the same D, X, N, and E values.
**
** {F16112} The [sqlite3_create_function(D,X,...)] interface fails with
**          a return code of [SQLITE_ERROR] if the SQL function name X is
**          longer than 255 bytes exclusive of the zero terminator.
**
** {F16118} Either F must be NULL and S and L are non-NULL or else F
**          is non-NULL and S and L are NULL, otherwise
**          [sqlite3_create_function(D,X,N,E,P,F,S,L)] returns [SQLITE_ERROR].

**          than -1 or greater than 127.
**
** {F16127} When N is non-negative, the [sqlite3_create_function(D,X,N,...)]
**          interface causes callbacks to be invoked for the SQL function
**          named X when the number of arguments to the SQL function is
**          exactly N.
**
** {F16130} When N is -1, the [sqlite3_create_function(D,X,N,...)]

**          the implementation with a non-zero N is preferred.
**
** {F16136} When calls to [sqlite3_create_function(D,X,N,E,...)]
**          specify multiple implementations of the same function X with
**          the same number of arguments N but with different
**          encodings E, then the implementation where E matches the
**          database encoding is preferred.
**
** {F16139} For an aggregate SQL function created using
**          [sqlite3_create_function(D,X,N,E,P,0,S,L)] the finializer

** CAPI3REF: Obtaining SQL Function Parameter Values {F15100}

** The C-language implementation of SQL functions and aggregates uses

**
** The xFunc (for scalar functions) or xStep (for aggregates) parameters
** to [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** define callbacks that implement the SQL functions and aggregates.
** The 4th parameter to these callbacks is an array of pointers to
** [protected sqlite3_value] objects.  There is one [sqlite3_value] object for
** each parameter to the SQL function.  These routines are used to
** extract values from the [sqlite3_value] objects.
**
** These routines work only with [protected sqlite3_value] objects.
** Any attempt to use these routines on an [unprotected sqlite3_value]
** object results in undefined behavior.
**
** These routines work just like the corresponding 
** [sqlite3_column_blob | sqlite3_column_* routines] except that 
** these routines take a single [protected sqlite3_value] object pointer
** instead of an [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
**
** The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF16 string
** in the native byte-order of the host machine.  The
** sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
** extract UTF16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.
**
** The sqlite3_value_numeric_type() interface attempts to apply
** numeric affinity to the value.  This means that an attempt is
** made to convert the value to an integer or floating point.  If
** such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other
** words if the value is a string that looks like a number)
** then the conversion is done.  Otherwise no conversion occurs.  The 
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype] after conversion is returned.
**
** Please pay particular attention to the fact that the pointer that
** is returned from [sqlite3_value_blob()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or
** [sqlite3_value_text16()] can be invalidated by a subsequent call to
** [sqlite3_value_bytes()], [sqlite3_value_bytes16()], [sqlite3_value_text()],

** CAPI3REF: Setting The Result Of An SQL Function {F16400}
**
** These routines are used by the xFunc or xFinal callbacks that
** implement SQL functions and aggregates.  See
** [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** for additional information.
**
** These functions work very much like the 
** [sqlite3_bind_blob | sqlite3_bind_*] family of functions used
** to bind values to host parameters in prepared statements.
** Refer to the
** [sqlite3_bind_blob | sqlite3_bind_* documentation] for
** additional information.
**
** The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from
** an application defined function to be the BLOB whose content is pointed
** to by the second parameter and which is N bytes long where N is the
** third parameter. 
** The sqlite3_result_zeroblob() inerfaces set the result of
** the application defined function to be a BLOB containing all zero
** bytes and N bytes in size, where N is the value of the 2nd parameter.
**
** The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF8. SQLite
** interprets the string from sqlite3_result_error16() as UTF16 in native
** byte order.  If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
** message all text up through the first zero character.
** If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or
** sqlite3_result_error16() is non-negative then SQLite takes that many
** bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()
** routines make a copy private copy of the error message text before
** they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or
** modify the text after they return without harm.
** The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
** returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  By default,
** the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() resets the error code to SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** The sqlite3_result_toobig() interface causes SQLite
** to throw an error indicating that a string or BLOB is to long
** to represent.  The sqlite3_result_nomem() interface
** causes SQLite to throw an exception indicating that the a
** memory allocation failed.
**
** The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 32-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
** The sqlite3_result_int64() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 64-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
**
** The sqlite3_result_null() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be NULL.
**
** The sqlite3_result_text(), sqlite3_result_text16(), 
** sqlite3_result_text16le(), and sqlite3_result_text16be() interfaces
** set the return value of the application-defined function to be
** a text string which is represented as UTF-8, UTF-16 native byte order,
** UTF-16 little endian, or UTF-16 big endian, respectively.
** SQLite takes the text result from the application from
** the 2nd parameter of the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces.
** If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is negative, then SQLite takes result text from the 2nd parameter 
** through the first zero character.
** If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is non-negative, then as many bytes (not characters) of the text
** pointed to by the 2nd parameter are taken as the application-defined
** function result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that
** function as the destructor on the text or blob result when it has
** finished using that result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_STATIC, then
** SQLite assumes that the text or blob result is constant space and
** does not copy the space or call a destructor when it has
** finished using that result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_TRANSIENT
** then SQLite makes a copy of the result into space obtained from
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] before it returns.
**
** The sqlite3_result_value() interface sets the result of
** the application-defined function to be a copy the
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object specified by the 2nd parameter.  The
** sqlite3_result_value() interface makes a copy of the [sqlite3_value]
** so that [sqlite3_value] specified in the parameter may change or
** be deallocated after sqlite3_result_value() returns without harm.
** A [protected sqlite3_value] object may always be used where an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object is required, so either
** kind of [sqlite3_value] object can be used with this interface.

**
** The name of the new collation sequence is specified as a UTF-8 string
** for sqlite3_create_collation() and sqlite3_create_collation_v2()
** and a UTF-16 string for sqlite3_create_collation16(). In all cases
** the name is passed as the second function argument.
**
** The third argument may be one of the constants [SQLITE_UTF8],
** [SQLITE_UTF16LE] or [SQLITE_UTF16BE], indicating that the user-supplied
** routine expects to be passed pointers to strings encoded using UTF-8,
** UTF-16 little-endian or UTF-16 big-endian respectively. The
** third argument might also be [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] to indicate that
** the routine expects pointers to 16-bit word aligned strings
** of UTF16 in the native byte order of the host computer.
**
** A pointer to the user supplied routine must be passed as the fifth
** argument.  If it is NULL, this is the same as deleting the collation
** sequence (so that SQLite cannot call it anymore).
** Each time the application
** supplied function is invoked, it is passed a copy of the void* passed as
** the fourth argument to sqlite3_create_collation() or
** sqlite3_create_collation16() as its first parameter.
**
** The remaining arguments to the application-supplied routine are two strings,
** each represented by a (length, data) pair and encoded in the encoding
** that was passed as the third argument when the collation sequence was
** registered. {END} The application defined collation routine should
** return negative, zero or positive if
** the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second
** string. i.e. (STRING1 - STRING2).
**
** The sqlite3_create_collation_v2() works like sqlite3_create_collation()
** excapt that it takes an extra argument which is a destructor for
** the collation.  The destructor is called when the collation is
** destroyed and is passed a copy of the fourth parameter void* pointer
** of the sqlite3_create_collation_v2().
** Collations are destroyed when
** they are overridden by later calls to the collation creation functions
** or when the [sqlite3*] database handle is closed using [sqlite3_close()].

**
** {F16612} A collating function is dropped when it is overloaded.

** can be used, a single callback function may be registered with the
** database handle to be called whenever an undefined collation sequence is
** required.
**
** If the function is registered using the sqlite3_collation_needed() API,

** encoded in UTF-8. {F16703} If sqlite3_collation_needed16() is used, the names

** function replaces any existing callback.
**
** When the callback is invoked, the first argument passed is a copy
** of the second argument to sqlite3_collation_needed() or
** sqlite3_collation_needed16().  The second argument is the database
** handle.  The third argument is one of [SQLITE_UTF8],
** [SQLITE_UTF16BE], or [SQLITE_UTF16LE], indicating the most
** desirable form of the collation sequence function required.
** The fourth parameter is the name of the

**
** The sqlite3_index_info structure and its substructures is used to
** pass information into and receive the reply from the xBestIndex
** method of an sqlite3_module.  The fields under **Inputs** are the
** inputs to xBestIndex and are read-only.  xBestIndex inserts its
** results into the **Outputs** fields.
**
** The aConstraint[] array records WHERE clause constraints of the
** form:
**
**         column OP expr
**
** Where OP is =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or &gt;=.  
** The particular operator is stored
** in aConstraint[].op.  The index of the column is stored in 
** aConstraint[].iColumn.  aConstraint[].usable is TRUE if the
** expr on the right-hand side can be evaluated (and thus the constraint
** is usable) and false if it cannot.
**
** The optimizer automatically inverts terms of the form "expr OP column"
** and makes other simplifications to the WHERE clause in an attempt to
** get as many WHERE clause terms into the form shown above as possible.
** The aConstraint[] array only reports WHERE clause terms in the correct
** form that refer to the particular virtual table being queried.
**
** Information about the ORDER BY clause is stored in aOrderBy[].
** Each term of aOrderBy records a column of the ORDER BY clause.
**
** The xBestIndex method must fill aConstraintUsage[] with information
** about what parameters to pass to xFilter.  If argvIndex>0 then
** the right-hand side of the corresponding aConstraint[] is evaluated
** and becomes the argvIndex-th entry in argv.  If aConstraintUsage[].omit
** is true, then the constraint is assumed to be fully handled by the
** virtual table and is not checked again by SQLite.
**
** The idxNum and idxPtr values are recorded and passed into xFilter.
** sqlite3_free() is used to free idxPtr if needToFreeIdxPtr is true.
**
** The orderByConsumed means that output from xFilter will occur in
** the correct order to satisfy the ORDER BY clause so that no separate
** sorting step is required.
**
** The estimatedCost value is an estimate of the cost of doing the
** particular lookup.  A full scan of a table with N entries should have

** CAPI3REF: Mutexes {F17000}
**
** The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
** synchronization.  Though they are intended for internal
** use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
** permitted to use any of these routines.
**
** The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations 
** of these mutex routines.  An appropriate implementation
** is selected automatically at compile-time.  The following
** implementations are available in the SQLite core:
**
** <ul>
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines 
** that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in 
** a single-threaded application.  The SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2,
** SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD, and SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations
** are appropriate for use on os/2, unix, and windows.
** 
** If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
** macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library.  The
** mutex interface routines defined here become external
** references in the SQLite library for which implementations
** must be provided by the application.  This facility allows an
** application that links against SQLite to provide its own mutex
** implementation without having to modify the SQLite core.
**
** {F17011} The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. {F17012} If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated. {F17013} SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error. {F17014} The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU2
** </ul> {END}
**
** {F17015} The first two constants cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used. {END}
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  {F17016} But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  {END} If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** {F17017} The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex. {END}  Four static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** {F17018} Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  {F17034} But for the static 
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number. {END}
**
** {F17019} The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex. {F17020} SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** dynamic mutex that it allocates. {U17021} The dynamic mutexes must not be in 
** use when they are deallocated. {U17022} Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior. {F17023} SQLite never deallocates
** a static mutex. {END}
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex. {F17024} If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY. {F17025}  The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns SQLITE_OK
** upon successful entry.  {F17026} Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
** {F17027} In such cases the,
** mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
** can enter.  {U17028} If the same thread tries to enter any other
** kind of mutex more than once, the behavior is undefined.
** {F17029} SQLite will never exhibit
** such behavior in its own use of mutexes. {END}
**
** Some systems (ex: windows95) do not the operation implemented by
** sqlite3_mutex_try().  On those systems, sqlite3_mutex_try() will
** always return SQLITE_BUSY.  {F17030} The SQLite core only ever uses
** sqlite3_mutex_try() as an optimization so this is acceptable behavior. {END}
**
** {F17031} The sqlite3_mutex_leave() routine exits a mutex that was
** previously entered by the same thread.  {U17032} The behavior
** is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered by the
** calling thread or is not currently allocated.  {F17033} SQLite will
** never do either. {END}
