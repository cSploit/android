This OpenSSL repository is unmaintained
=======================================

Android no longer uses OpenSSL and has instead moved to BoringSSL. As a result
this repository is unmaintained. It should not be used.

Most applications can move to using BoringSSL as long as they are not
using deprecated APIs. For more information about BoringSSL, see these
references:

    official BoringSSL repository.
  * [Android's BoringSSL project](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/boringssl/):
    Android's copy of BoringSSL.
