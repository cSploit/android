dnl LBL autoconf macros

dnl
dnl Do whatever AC_LBL_C_INIT work is necessary before using AC_PROG_CC.
dnl
dnl It appears that newer versions of autoconf (2.64 and later) will,
dnl if you use AC_TRY_COMPILE in a macro, stick AC_PROG_CC at the
dnl beginning of the macro, even if the macro itself calls AC_PROG_CC.
dnl See the "Prerequisite Macros" and "Expanded Before Required" sections
dnl in the Autoconf documentation.
dnl
dnl This causes a steaming heap of fail in our case, as we were, in
dnl AC_LBL_C_INIT, doing the tests we now do in AC_LBL_C_INIT_BEFORE_CC,
dnl calling AC_PROG_CC, and then doing the tests we now do in
dnl AC_LBL_C_INIT.  Now, we run AC_LBL_C_INIT_BEFORE_CC, AC_PROG_CC,
dnl and AC_LBL_C_INIT at the top level.

dnl Determine which compiler we're using (cc or gcc)
dnl If using gcc, determine the version number
dnl If using cc:
dnl     require that it support ansi prototypes
dnl     use -O (AC_PROG_CC will use -g -O2 on gcc, so we don't need to
dnl     do that ourselves for gcc)
dnl     add -g flags, as appropriate
dnl     explicitly specify /usr/local/include

dnl NOTE WELL: with newer versions of autoconf, "gcc" means any compiler
dnl that defines __GNUC__, which means clang, for example, counts as "gcc".

dnl AC_LBL_LIBRARY_NET
dnl
dnl This test is for network applications that need socket functions and

dnl getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo().  We also prefer versions of
dnl recvmsg() that conform to the Single UNIX Specification, so that we
dnl can check whether a datagram received with recvmsg() was truncated
dnl when received due to the buffer being too small.
dnl
dnl On most operating systems, they're available in the system library.
dnl
dnl Under Solaris, we need to link with libsocket and libnsl to get
dnl getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() and, if we have libxnet, we need to
dnl link with libxnet before libsocket to get a version of recvmsg()
dnl that conforms to the Single UNIX Specification.
dnl
dnl We use getaddrinfo() because we want a portable thread-safe way
dnl of getting information for a host name or port; there exist _r
dnl versions of gethostbyname() and getservbyname() on some platforms,
dnl but not on all platforms.
