	* builtins/hashcom.h: Make declarations of hashed_filenames be
	"extern" to keep the SGI compiler happy.

	* readline.c (rl_initialize_everything): Assign values to

	is non-zero if we want to blink the matching open when a close is
	inserted.  If FD_SET is defined, rl_blink_matching_paren defaults
	to 1, else 0.  If FD_SET is not defined, and
	rl_blink_matching_paren is non-zero, the close character(s) are/is
	simply inserted.

	USGr3ness.

	* readline.c (rl_unix_word_rubout) As per the "Now REMEMBER"

	with a leading `~', remember that this could be a filename (after
	it is completed).

Thu Apr  5 13:44:24 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: rl_search_history (): Correctly handle case of an
	unfound search string, but a graceful exit (as with ESC).

	* readline.c: rl_restart_output ();  The Apollo passes the address
	of the file descriptor to TIOCSTART, not the descriptor itself.

Tue Mar 20 05:38:55 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: rl_complete (); second call in a row causes possible
	completions to be listed.

	  as meta-bit iff the terminal is not using parity.

Sun Sep  3 08:57:40 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: start_insert ().  Uses multiple
	  insertion call in cases where that makes sense.

	  rl_insert ().  Read type-ahead buffer for additional
	  keys that are bound to rl_insert, and insert them
	  all at once.  Make insertion of single keys given
	  with an argument much more efficient.

Tue Aug  8 18:13:57 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: Changed handling of EOF.  readline () returns
	 (char *)EOF or consed string.  The EOF character is read from the
	 tty, or if the tty doesn't have one, defaults to C-d.

	* readline.c: Added support for event driven programs.
	  rl_event_hook is the address of a function you want called
	  while Readline is waiting for input.

	* readline.c: Cleanup time.  Functions without type declarations
	  do not use return with a value.

	* history.c: history_expand () has new variable which is the
	  characters to ignore immediately following history_expansion_char.

	  of reading the line.

Tue Jul 11 06:25:01 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: new variable rl_tilde_expander.
	  If non-null, this contains the address of a function to call if
	  the standard meaning for expanding a tilde fails.  The function is
	  called with the text sans tilde (as in "foo"), and returns a
	  malloc()'ed string which is the expansion, or a NULL pointer if
	  there is no expansion. 

	* readline.h - new file chardefs.h
	  Separates things that only readline.c needs from the standard
	  header file publishing interesting things about readline.

	* readline.c:
	  readline_default_bindings () now looks at terminal chararacters
	  and binds those as well.

Wed Jun 28 20:20:51 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* Made readline and history into independent libraries.
