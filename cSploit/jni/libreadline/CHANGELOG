	  autoconf set the value itself in the Makefile
	- removed a stray `-' before $(RANLIB) in the `install' recipe

doc/Makefile.in
	- add a VPATH assignment so the documentation is not remade if it's
	  already up-to-date in the distribution

configure.in
	- call AC_SUBST(LOCAL_LDFLAGS), since Makefile.in contains
	  @LOCAL_LDFLAGS@

				    4/2
				    ---
configure.in
	- bumped LIBVERSION up to 2.2

				   4/18
				   ----
[readline-2.2 released]

				   4/20
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- make `libhistory.a' a dependency of `install'
	- fixed a typo in the recipe for `install' that copied libreadline.a
	  to libhistory.old right after installing it

				   4/27
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- install {readline,history}.info out of the source directory if
	  they are not found in the current (build) directory -- only an
	  issue if the libraries are built in a different directory than
	  the source directory

				    5/1
				    ---
support/shobj-conf
	- script from the bash distribution to do shared object and library
	  configuration

Makefile.in
	- bumped SHLIB_MAJOR up to 4 since we've augmented the library

rlstdc.h
	- new file

Makefile.in
	- rlstdc.h is now one of the installed headers

				    8/3
				    ---
shlib/Makefile.in
	- made the suffix rule that creates xx.so from xx.c write the
	  compiler output to `a.o', which is then mv'd to xx.so, because
	  some compilers (Sun WSpro 4.2, for example) don't allow any
	  suffixes other than `.o' for `cc -c' (not even `a.out')

				   9/15
				   ----

Makefile.in

				   ----
Makefile.in
	- removed savestring.o from object file list

				   10/28
				   -----
shlib/Makefile.in

	  problems with parallel makes

				   12/21
				   -----
support/shlib-install
	- new script to install shared readline and history libraries

shlib/Makefile.in
	- changed to call shlib-install for install and uninstall targets

[readline-4.0-beta1 frozen]

				   -----
configure.in
	- call AC_SUBST for SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS and SHLIB_LIBS

shlib/Makefile.in
	- SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS and SHLIB_LIBS are now substituted by configure
	- add $(SHLIB_LIBS) at end of command line that builds the shared
	  libraries (currently needed only by AIX 4.2)

				   12/31
				   -----
MANIFEST, MANIFEST.doc
	- the TOC html files are no longer generated and no longer part of
	  the distribution

				 2/18/1999
				 ---------
configure.in

	- set SHELL from @MAKE_SHELL@

[readline-4.0 released]

doc/Makefile.in
	- removed references to HTMLTOC, since separate HTML table-of-contents
	  files are no longer created

	- clean target now removes readline and readline.exe in case they
	  get built

				    4/8
				    ---

xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h
	- new files

Makefile.in,shlib/Makefile.in
	- add dependencies on xmalloc.h, rlshell.h
	- add xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h to list of header files

	- add xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h

				    4/9
				    ---
Makefile.in,shlib/Makefile.in
	- add dependencies on rlprivate.h

				   4/13
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- add variable, PSDVI, which is the desired resolution of the
	  generated postscript files.  Set to 300 because I don't have
	  any 600-dpi printers
	- set LANGUAGE= before calling makeinfo, so messages are in English
	- add rluserman.{info,dvi,ps,html} to appropriate variables

configure.in
	- SHLIB_MAJOR and SHLIB_MINOR shared library version numbers are
	  constructed from $LIBRARY_VERSION and substituted into Makefiles

				    5/5
				    ---
support/shlib-install
	- OSF/1 installs shared libraries like Solaris

Makefile.in
	- broke the header file install and uninstall into two new targets:
	  install-headers and uninstall-headers
	- install and uninstall depend on install-headers and uninstall-headers
	  respectively
	- changed install-shared and uninstall-shared targets to depend on
	  install-headers and uninstall-headers, respectively, so users may
	  choose to install only the shared libraries.  I'm not sure about
	  the uninstall one yet -- maybe it should check whether or not
	  the static libraries are installed and not remove the header files
	  if they are

				    9/3
				    ---
configure.in, config.h.in
	- added test for memmove (for later use)

	- install shared libraries unwritable by anyone on HP-UX
	- changed symlinks to relative pathnames on all platforms

	- add call to AC_PROG_MAKE_SET

				   8/30
				   ----
shlib/Makefile.in
	- change the soname bound into the shared libraries, so it includes
	  only the major version number.  If it includes the minor version,
	  programs depending on it must be rebuilt (which may or may not be
	  a bad thing)

				   11/2
				   ----
compat.c
	- new file, with backwards-compatibility function definitions

Makefile.in,shlib/Makefile.in
	- make sure that compat.o/compat.so are built and linked apppropriately

support/shobj-conf
	- picked up bash version, which means that shared libs built on
	  linux and BSD/OS 4.x will have an soname that does not include
	  the minor version number

				   11/13
				   -----
examples/rlfe.c
	- rlfe can perform filename completion for relative pathnames in the
	  inferior process's context if the OS supports /proc/PID/cwd (linux
	  does it OK, Solaris is slightly warped, none of the BSDs have it)

				    8/7
				    ---
support/shlib-install

	  distributions are all moving to the following scheme:

		libreadline.so.4.3	installed version
		libreadline.so.4 -> libreadline.so.4.3	symlink

				   10/29

	- make install-doc and uninstall-doc prerequisites of appropriate
	  install and uninstall targets

	  that call readline in a shared library that can be interposed with
	  LD_PRELOAD

				   11/15
				   -----

				 ---------
configure.in
        - set BUILD_DIR to contain backslashes to escape any spaces in the
          directory name -- this is what make will accept in targets and
          prerequisites, so it's better than trying to use double quotes

				   2/25
				   ----
configure.in
	- change check for sys/ptem.h to include sys/stream.h if present, to
	  avoid the `present but cannot be compiled' messages on Solaris and

examples/Makefile.in
	- use $(READLINE_LIB) instead of -lreadline to get around MacOS X 10.4's
	  preference for (incompatible) shared libraries over static libraries
	  in the load path

				   8/11
				   ----
support/shobj-conf
	- new variable: SHLIB_LIBPREF, prefix for shared library name (defaults
	  to `lib'
	- new variable: SHLIB_DLLVERSION, used on Cygwin to set the library
	  version number
	- new variable: SHLIB_DOT, separator character between library name and
	  suffix and version information (defaults to `.')
	- new stanza for cygwin to generate windows-compatible dll

support/shlib-install
	- add new option `-b bindir' for systems like cygwin/windows that
	  require it
	- new stanza for cygwin that installs a dll into $bindir and an implied
	  link library into $libdir

configure.in
	- substitute new variables from shobj-conf

shlib/Makefile.in
	- substitute bindir, SHLIB_DOT, SHLIB_LIBPREF, SHLIB_DLLVERSION from
	  configure
	- pass `-b $(bindir)' to shlib-install for install and uninstall targets
	- library names now use $SHLIB_LIBPREF and $SHLIB_DOT

INSTALL,README
	- document new SHLIB_DOT, SHLIB_LIBPREF, and SHLIB_DLLVERSION variables

	  creation section
	- add support for FreeBSD/gentoo, which uses Linux library naming
	  scheme

	- COLOR_SUPPORT: if defined, compile in colors.c and parse-colors.c
	  for color support

				   1/18

	- install-examples: should not depend on `shared', since the examples
	  themselves are not built using shared libraries.  Report from
	  <hiroo.hayashi@computer.org>

support/shobj-conf
	- [from bash] darwin: changed the install_name embedded into the
	  shared library to contain only the major version number, not the
	  minor one. The idea is that the minor versions should all be API/ABI
	  compatible, and it is better to link automatically with the latest
	  one.  Idea from Max Horn <max@quendi.de>
