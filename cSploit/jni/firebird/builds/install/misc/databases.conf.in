#
# Makes it possible to specify per-database configuration parameters.
# See the list of them and description on file firebird.conf.
# To place that parameters in this file add them in curly braces
# after "alias = /path/to/database.fdb" line. Example:
#	big = /databases/bigdb.fdb
#	{
#		LockMemSize = 32M		# We know that bigdb needs a lot of locks
#		LockHashSlots = 19927	#	and big enough hash table for them
#	}
#

#
# Example Database:
#
employee.fdb = $(dir_sampleDb)/employee.fdb
employee = $(dir_sampleDb)/employee.fdb

#
# Master security database specific setup.
# Do not remove it until you understand well what are you doing!
#
security.db = $(dir_secDb)/security3.fdb
{
	RemoteAccess = false
	DefaultDbCachePages = 50
}
