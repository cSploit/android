For general parameters available to all InnoSetup based installers see the 
documentation for innosetup. A summary is available via /? or /HELP


Parameters specific to Firebird installs
----------------------------------------

/h
  Invoke this file as a help screen at installation time.
  Note that /? and /HELP are now used by innosetup itself for
  innosetup specific help.

/COMPONENTS="comma separated list of component names"

  Choose from - ServerComponent\SuperServerComponent,
                ServerComponent\ClassicServerComponent,
                ServerComponent,
                DevAdminComponent and
                ClientComponent

  Overrides the default components settings. Using this command line
  parameter causes Setup to automatically select a custom type. A full
  install requires combining components. For example:

  /COMPONENTS="ServerComponent\SuperServerComponent,ServerComponent,DevAdminComponent,ClientComponent"

  would be required for a full install.

/TASKS="comma separated list of task names"

  Specifies a list of tasks that should be initially selected or
  deselected. To deselect a task, prefix its name with a "!" character.

  Choose from - UseGuardianTask
                UseApplicationTask
                UseServiceTask
                AutoStartTask
                InstallCPLAppletTask
                MenuGroupTask
                CopyFbClientToSysTask
                CopyFbClientAsGds32Task

  Only the specified tasks (and their children) will be selected; the rest
  will be deselected. Use the /MERGETASKS parameter instead if you want to
  keep the default set of tasks and only select/deselect some of them.

  By default the following tasks are run:

    UseGuardianTask
    UseServiceTask
    AutoStartTask
    InstallCPLAppletTask
    MenuGroupTask
    CopyFbClientAsGds32Task

  The /TASKS option is not recommended for use with the /NOCPL, NOGDS32
  or /COPYFBCLIENT.


/MERGETASKS="comma separated list of task names"

  Like the /TASKS parameter, except the specified tasks will be merged
  with the set of tasks that would have otherwise been selected by
  default.

  If UsePreviousTasks is set to yes, the specified tasks will be
  selected/deselected after any previous tasks are restored.


/FORCE

  Tells the installer to ignore its analysis of the existing
  environment. It will attempt to install and configure Firebird as
  if no previous version of Firebird or InterBase was installed.

  This can be useful if you have a seriously broken installation that
  you cannot uninstall. Or it could be another way to aggravate your
  users by breaking a perfectly good working install of Firebird or InterBase.
  Its your choice.


/NOCPL

  Don't install the Control Panel Applet.

  (This option is not intended to be used with the /TASKS parameter.)


/NOGDS32

  Don't install a copy of the client library as gds32 into the system directory,
  even if installation analysis concludes it is OK to do so.

  (This option is not intended to be used with the /TASKS parameter.)


/COPYFBCLIENT

  Copy the fbclient.dll to the system directory. This is recommended
  for client installs if you are sure that you will only ever be
  accessing a single server version. If your client applications are
  likely to take advantage of accessing different server versions this
  is not recommended. See
    doc/README.Win32LibraryInstallation.txt
  for more information.

  (This option is not intended to be used with the /TASKS parameter.)

  
/SYSDBANAME="SYSDBA"

  SYSDBA name will default to SYSDBA unless overridden with this parameter.
  
  NOTE: If an existing Security database is found this parameter should be 
  ignored but this has not been fully tested as of Alpha1.

  
/SYSDBAPASSWORD="masterkey"

  SYSDBA password will use the default "masterkey" password.
  
  NOTE: If an existing Security database is found this parameter should be 
  ignored but this has not been fully tested as of Alpha1.
  

/SUPPORTLEGACYCLIENTAUTH

  Updates firebird.conf. Sets AuthServer thus:
    AuthServer = Srp, Win_Sspi, Legacy_Auth

  NOTE: This option does not check to see if AuthServer has already been 
  modified.


  
Parameters specific to Firebird uninstalls
------------------------------------------

/CLEAN

  Uninstallation has always left the following files in place after
  the uninstallation process has completed:

    firebird.conf
    databases.conf
    firebird.log
    security3.fdb
	fbtrace.conf

  The assumption is that these files will be useful to users
  re-installing or upgrading Firebird. Starting with Firebird 2.1
  (using InnoSetup 5 to build the installation package) it is now
  possible to pass the /clean option to remove these files.
