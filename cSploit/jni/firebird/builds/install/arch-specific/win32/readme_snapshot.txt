Firebird 2 Snapshot Build
=========================

CAUTION

This is a daily snapshot build. It is intended for Firebird
developers and experienced beta testers.  It is generated automatically.
It is untested. It comes with no guarantees. It may work and it may screw up
your system. Do not use it unless you know what you are doing.


Installation
------------

There is no installation routine. This is deliberate. Snapshot builds are
intended to be copied over an existing install.


Problems and bug reports
------------------------

If this snapshot build does not work at all it is not a bug.
Please do not report it. Windows snapshot builds are based on a daily CVS
checkout that occurs at around 5:00 AM UT every day. The process is entirely
automated and the resulting build is untested. There is no guarantee that the
CVS tree was in a stable, buildable state when the snapshot was taken. However
there is usually very little activity at this time, so the likelihood is that
the build will be good.

The purpose of snapshot builds is to provide the engine developers with feed-
back concerning bug fixes. So please report positive experiences if you find
your bug is now fixed, as well as problems with bugs that are meant to be fixed.

Of course, new bug reports are always welcome.

Please use the firebird-devel mailing list to discuss problems first.
Do not file bug reports with the Firebird bug tracker on SourceForge. It is
reserved for problems with production versions of Firebird. Use the Field Test
tracker instead.

Happy testing!


The Firebird Project.
