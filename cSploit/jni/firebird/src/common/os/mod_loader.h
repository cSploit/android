/***
	The ModuleLoader class is an abstraction of the dynamic code loading
	facilities provided by the host operating system.  The class provides
	functions to determine if the file at a given path is a loadable module,
	to load that module, and to modify the filename in a way that is
	appropiate to the host computer.

	All implementations of this interface are expected to provide definitions
	for the 3 static functions in the ModuleLoader class, and provide a
	subclass of ModuleLoader::Loader that implements findSymbol.

		using the ModuleLoader::loadModule function.
