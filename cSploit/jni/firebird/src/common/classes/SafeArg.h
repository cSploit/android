class BaseStream;

// This is the main class that does the magic of receiving a chain of type-safe
// parameters. All parameters should be appended to it using the << operator.
// Only basic data types are supported.
// The allowed types are char, UCHAR, all lengths of signed/unsigned integral values,
// the SINT128 fake type (a struct, really), double, strings, UCHAR strings and the
// (non-const) void pointer. Care should be taken to not pass something by address
// (except char* and UCHAR* types) because the compiler may route it to the overload
// for the void pointer and it will be printed as an address in hex.
// An object of this class can be created, filled and passed later to the printing
// routines, cleaned with clear(), refilled and passed again to the printing routines
// or simply constructed as an anonymous object and being filled at the same time
// that it serves as input to the printing routines (the MsgPrint family).
// Using << to pass more than 7 parameters will ignore the rest of the parameters
// silently instead of throwing exceptions or crashing.
// Only the full MsgPrint is declared a friend below, so the other routines should
// work through it.
// Typically the construction doesn't have parameters, but there's an overload
// that takes an array of integers. If the array has more than 7 elements, the
// rest are ignored. Then probably no more parameters will be pushed using <<.
// A dump() method is provided to dump all the parameters to a TEXT array or up
// to the number of elements in the target array if it's smallers than the number
// of parameters in SafeArg. In case it's bigger, the elements are set to NULL.
// Finally getCount() and getCell() are provided for the rare need to loop
// retrieving individual parameters as safe_cell structures. No provision is
// made to modify parameters once pushed into a SafeArg object.
// The parameter formatting is just an indication for the future, thus the
// m_extras pointer is not used for now. No need for parameter formatting (like
// alignment, width, precision, padding, numeric base) was evident as the msg.fdb
// contains rather simple format strings.
// Usage examples appear in the MsgPrint.h file.
