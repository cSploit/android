LICENSES
--------

The applicable and approved licenses for the source files
of the Firebird RDBMS project are:

  1) InterBase Public License (IPL), version 1.0
     http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/interbase-public-license

  2) Initial Developer's Public License (IDPL), version 1.0
     http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/initial-developer-s-public-license-version-1-0/

The IPL is copyright of Borland Corp., the other licenses are copyright
by the source code authors and contributors.


USAGE RULES
-----------

1) The source code which was released under the IPL must keep this license.
   All modifications / adaptations of this code are still subjects of the IPL.

2) The files that are derived from the IPL covered code, must also keep
   this license. It means that if any new file contains some code covered by
   the IPL, then this file should be released under the IPL too.

3) The new files developed by the members of the Firebird project should
   be released under the IDPL.

4) The new files contributed by people who are not members of the Firebird
   project should follow the rule #3. If an author (initial developer) doesn't
   specify the license to be used, the person who applies the contributed code
   to the SVN tree (a committer) becomes responsible for the license assigned
   to the contributed code.

5) Every non-binary file that exists in the SVN tree, should have a header
   section which describes the license this code is released under. If a file
   contains no header, it means that this code is freeware and nobody owns the
   appropriate copyrights.


You may find the exhibits for the approved licenses in /doc/license directory
of the SVN tree.
