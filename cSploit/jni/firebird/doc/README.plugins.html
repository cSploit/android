<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Since version 3, Firebird
supports plugins architecture. This means that for a number of
predefined points in Firebird code, user can write his own fragment
of code which will be executed when needed. Plugin is not necessarily
always written by user - Firebird already has a number of plugins
which are its native part. Moreover, as you will see later, some core
parts of Firebird are implemented as plugins. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>First of all a few words
about the term &ldquo;plugin&rdquo;. Unfortunately, it's often used
to define related but different things. Plugin is used to name:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>dynamic library,
	containing code to be loaded as plugin (often called plugin module)
	and stored in $FIREBIRD/plugins directory;</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>code implementing
	plugin &ndash; slightly different from the library cause single
	dynamic library may contain code for more than one plugin;</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>plugin's factory - an
	object created by that code (pure virtual C++ class), creating
	plugin instances on Firebird request;</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>instance of plugin,
	created by factory.</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>In most cases it's clear
from context what &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; do we talk about. If not it
will be clarified explicitly.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Firebird plugin
architecture supports creation of any plugin type for any purpose &ndash;
but first of all this requires changes in Firebird code. Plugin can't
be added at any desired point &ldquo;magically&rdquo;. To be able to
have plugin (for example) encrypting database on the disk, Firebird
code should be prepared for it &ndash; must have a point from which
plugin is called. I.e. each version has a fixed set of plugins which
are supported. To add one more type, first of all Firebird code
should be modified. What DOES our plugin architecture &ndash; it
helps to make both adding new types of plugins and writing plugin
code simple and as universal between plugins as possible.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Firebird 3 has a following
set of plugin types:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>user authentication
	related: AuthServer (validates user's credentials on server when use
	logins), AuthClient (prepares credentials to be passed over the
	wire) and AuthUserManagement (maintains a list of users on a server
	in a form, known to AuthServer);</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>ExternalEngine
	controls use of various engines, see README.external_routines;</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Trace plugin is known
	from Firebird 2.5, but a way how it interacts with engine was
	changed to match new generic rules; </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>encrypting plugins
	are for network (WireCrypt) and disk (DbCrypt), there is also helper
	plugin KeyHolder, which is used to help maintaining secret key(s)
	for DbCrypt;</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>and probably the most
	important kind &ndash; Provider. Firebird 3 supports providers as a
	kind of plugins, which has nothing outstanding compared with others.
	See README.Providers for more information about providers. </FONT>
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Plugins are using a set of
special Firebird interfaces (see README.interfaces about interfaces
in Firebird). All plugin-specific interfaces are reference counted,
i.e. have explicitly controlled lifetime. Interfaces are declared in
Plugin.h include file. There is a simple example of writing plugin
module &ndash; DbCrypt_example. It does not perform any actual
encryption &ndash; just a sample of how to write plugin. Complete
instruction of how to write plugins is out of this document's scope.
Here is provided a short list of plugin features:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>plugin may be written
	using any language, supporting pure virtual interfaces (you will
	need to rewrite interfaces declarations for your language if they
	are missing);</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>like with UDFs you
	are free to add any reasonable code yo your plugin, but pay
	attention to word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; - asking a question from
	plugin at server's console is hardly good idea;</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>it's OK to use
	Firebird API calls in your plugin if needed (for example, default
	authentication server and user manager are using Firebird database
	to store accounts);</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>additionally Firebird
	provides a set of interfaces, helping you to configure your plugins
	(certainly, you are not forced to use them &ndash; plugin is generic
	code, which may use any way of providing configuration information,
	but with standard tools you get common for the rest of Firebird
	configuration style and sooner of all save you efforts).</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Configuring plugins has 2
parts &ndash; first, engine should be instructed what plugins it
should load, and next plugins themselves sometimes need some
configuration. What plugins to be loaded is defined in main
configuration file &ndash; firebird.conf for each type of plugin.
Like any other value in firebird.conf the have defaults:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>AuthServer = Srp,
Win_Sspi</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>AuthClient = Srp,
Win_Sspi, Legacy_Auth</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>UserManager = Srp</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>TracePlugin = fbtrace</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Providers =
Remote,Engine12,Loopback</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>WireCryptPlugin = Arc4</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>This provides normal
operation in server, client and embedded cases. If you want to add
other plugins, you must mention them in firebird.conf &ndash; except
other this is security measure to avoid loading unknown code. But
what does for example fbtrace mean here? Is it a name of dynamic
library to load? In trivial case yes, but exact answer is more
complicated.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>As it was already
mentioned, single plugin module may implement more than single
plugin. Moreover, single plugin may have at the same time more than
one configuration &ndash; and for each configuration separate
plugin's factory is created. Each of this 3 objects (module &ndash;
implementation &ndash; factory) has it's own name. Name of a module
is a file name of dynamic library. Plugin implementation's name is
one given to it by plugin developer and hard-coded inside module.
Factory's name by default equals to plugin implementation's name (and
it's factory name which is actually used in firebird.conf). Certainly
in typical trivial case, module contains one plugin, and that plugin
works with only one configuration, and all 3 names are equal, and no
more configuration is needed &ndash; for example libEngine12.so or
Engine12.dll contains implementation of provider Engine12, and
nothing else except record </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Providers = Engine12</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>in firebird.conf is needed
to load it. But if you have something complex &ndash; file will help
you to have such plugin factories which you really want.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>File plugins.conf has 2
types of records &ndash; config and plugin. Plugin record is a set of
rules for plugin's loading and activating. Plugin record has the
following format:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Plugin = PlugName ##
this is name to be referenced in firebird.conf</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>{</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Module = LibName ##
name of dynamic library</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>RegisterName = RegName
## name given to plugin by it's developer</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Config = ConfName ##
name of config record to be used</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>ConfigFile = ConfFile
## name of a file, containing plugin's configuration</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>}</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>i.e. when plugin PlugName
is needed Firebird loads library LibName, finds in it plugin
registered with name RegName and passes it configuration from config
record ConfName or config file ConfFile (config record is used if
both are given). Each parameter in this record may be missing, in
that case the default PlugName is used. The only exception is
ConfigFile &ndash; by default, file with same name as module's
dynamic library but .conf extension is used. ConfigFile is expected
to have format Key=Value (like other Firebird configuration files),
same format is used for plugin record:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Config = ConfName</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>{</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Key1 = Value1</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Key2 = Value2</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>...</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>}</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Let's have a sample.
Suppose some clients of your server trust wire encryption from one
vendor and others &ndash; from another one (and have different
licenses for appropriate client parts), but each vendor calls his
plugin BestCrypt. Certainly, first of all you have to rename
libraries to something like WC1 and WC2 &ndash; one can't have 2
files with same name in one directory. But after it, modules stop to
load automatically &ndash; they are not named BestCrypt any more. To
fix it, plugins.conf should contain something like this:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Plugin = WC1</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>{</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>RegisterName =
BestCrypt</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>}</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Plugin = WC2</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>{</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>RegisterName =
BestCrypt</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>}</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Module names will be
automatically set to WC1 and WC2 and found. Certainly you may add
some configuration info for plugins if needed. Also don't forget to
modify firebird.conf:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><I>WireCryptPlugin = WC1,
WC2</I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>After it server will
automatically select appropriate plugin to talk to client.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Another sample may be
found in distributed with Firebird plugins.conf. One of standard
plugins, UDR, is written to use non-default configuration. Therefore
module name and one configuration parameter are given explicitly.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Questions and answers.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Q. There are plugins named
Remote, Loopback, Arc4 in default configuration, but no libraries
with such names. How do they work?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>A. That are so-called
'built-in' plugins. They are built into fbclient library, and
therefore are always present. Arrival of such plugins is due to old
ability to distribute windows Firebird client as single dll. It was
decided to keep such feature at least for a case when standard set of
plugins is used.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Q. What do names of Srp
and Arc4 plugins mean?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>A. Srp implements Secure
Remote Passwords protocol which is default way of authenticating
users in Firebird 3. It has efficient password&rsquo;s length equal
to 20 bytes, resistant to most of attacks (including man in the
middle) and does not require exchanging any keys between client and
server to work. Arc4 means Alleged RC4 - an implementation of RC4
cypher. The advantage of SRP is that it can generate unique
cryptographically strong key on both client and server and it's
impossible to guess it capturing data transferred over the wire
during password validation by SRP. That key is used after SRP
handshake by Arc4, which makes wire encryption secure without need to
exchange any keys between client and server explicitly.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Q. And what do Win_Sspi
and Legacy_Auth mean?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>A. Windows SSPI was used
since FB 2.1 for windows trusted authentication. Legacy_Auth is
compatibility plugin. It's enabled by default on client to let it
connect to pre-FB3 servers. (Yes &ndash; it still transfers almost
plain passwords over the wire. Compatibility...) On server it works
with security database from FB 2.5, and should be avoided except
cases when you understand well what are you doing. To use Legacy_Auth
on server you should also disable network traffic encryption in
firebird.conf:</FONT></P>
