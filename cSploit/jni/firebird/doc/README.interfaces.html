<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Interfaces and objects
oriented API.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Why did we decide to add a
new API in Firebird 3? There was not single reason for it. May be the
first one is limited to 16 bit size of very many integers (for
example - message size, SQL operator length, portion of BLOB data) in
existing API. This probably was enough when that API was introduced &ndash;
but puts a lot of artificial limits today. The trivial way is to add
new functions that support 32 bit variables. But this solution does
not look beautiful because we obviously need to support old API too,
i.e. have 2 sets of functions with same functionality but different
integer sizes. To make such functions differ in 'plain C' API they
should have different names, i.e. a lot of isc_some_thing() calls
will have to have isc32_some_thing() (or fb32_some_thing()) pair.
Such solution was used to support 64 bit performance counters but not
because it's good and clear, we just could not suggest better one at
that moment with at the same time great need in 64 bit counters.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>The second reason is not
so clear from the first look but it's also important. It comes from
old times when Firebird's predecessor did not support SQL &ndash;
another language was used to manage databases (you may get an idea
what it was reading QLI's help). Data was delivered between client
and server using messages with format defined at request compilation
time by BLR (binary language representation) of that request. But SQL
operator does not contain description of message format and therefore
decision was taken &ndash; surround each message with short BLR
sequence (hard to call that program) describing it's format. For a
reason they had decided to follow that rule too exactly &ndash; and
each fetch of data from server now required sending BLR for it, i.e.
formatting BLR was sent not only at SQL compile time. The reason for
such strange at the first glance solution was presence of one more
layer on top of that messages based API - familiar to you SQLDA
(XSQLDA). Rather obvious that manually accompanying each SQL
statement with BLR is not efficient programming style, therefore
SQLDA was invented. But it encapsulates in same object both location
of data and there format making it formally possible to change
between fetch calls not only location but format too causing need in
BLR in each message-based fetch call. And to finish with this &ndash;
changing data format between fetches was broken at network layer in
pre-Firebird times. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>So what we have with calls
processing data &ndash; hard to extend (adding something to it is far
non-trivial task) and not very clear to use SQLDA, multilayer API
moving data from layer top layer and wasting time for it and &hellip;
big desire to fix that nonsense.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>There are a lot of other
reasons to change API like enhancing status vector or optimizing
dynamic library loading, but even mentioned two are enough to move to
the new one. BTW, in README.providers you will find the information
how interfaces help to use messages API easily and comfortably.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>When making any change in
software it's always desired to avoid loose of performance. And it
was performance issues that caused the choice of interfaces not
compatible with COM. To describe them I need to say a few words about
providers architecture of Firebird. The central part of it is YValve,
which is aimed on dispatching API call to correct provider, including
old providers that potentially have older interfaces than current
one. That means that to make sure that provider really has some new
API method we must (when using COM) call IUnknown method for each
fetch call. Taken together with the fact that new API calls are
sometimes added to optimize performance COM-based solution looks bad
for future Firebird versions.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Unlike COM, Firebird
interfaces support multiple versions. Version of Firebird interface
is defined in a rather native manner &ndash; it's a total number of
virtual functions in interface. And version of interface may be
upgraded! That does not mean that one gets full new functionality:
certainly that's impossible. But after upgrade virtual table is
expanded with function defined by the caller of interface upgrade,
and that function can perform minimum reasonable action &ndash; for
example in a case of providers return an error. This may seem a very
poor kind of upgrade, but at first - this is exactly what will be
done without upgrade after working with IUnknown and next &ndash;
after checking error code one can try to use other methods to do what
he wants. Certainly, not only error return may be done. Imagine that
we added something like phone number to an interface, listing users
from security database. When upgrading old interface it's OK to add a
function returning empty string as a phone number to get reasonable
behavior of old plugin.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>As an additional reason to
use non-COM interfaces it's good to notice that use of reference
counted interfaces in all cases is often an extra overhead. Some
interfaces have by definition unlimited lifetime (like IMaster &ndash;
main interfaces calling which functions one gets access to all the
rest of Firebird API), others &ndash; API strictly defined by
lifetime of parent interface, and for not multi-threaded things like
IStatus it's better to have simpler way to destroy it, i.e. dispose()
function.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT SIZE=4>Careful!</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>
An ability to upgrade interface version places one important limit on
implementation of interfaces: it should not contain virtual functions
(including virtual destructor) except those defined in interface
definition. This is because interface upgrade process modifies table
of virtual functions, and for successful upgrade, number of functions
in interface implementation should exactly match one in its
definition. Pointer to functions, missing in interface definition but
added in its implementation, may be </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT SIZE=4>overwritten</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>
with a pointer to function used to upgrade interface.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Discussing in details all
functions present in all interfaces is out of this document's scope.
Here I describe only hierarchy of them in general. The base of it is
IVersioned &ndash; interface that enables version upgrade. A lot of
interfaces, that do not require additional lifetime control, are
based directly on IVersioned. A sample is already mentioned IMaster
and a number of callback interfaces which lifetime must match the
lifetime of the object from which they may be used for callback.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Two interfaces, dealing
with lifetime control &ndash; IDisposable and IRefCounted. The last
one is used specially active to create other interfaces &ndash;
IPlugin is reference counted and a lot of other interfaces, used by
plugins, are reference counted too including interfaces that describe
database attachment, transaction and SQL statement.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Each plugin has one and
only one main interface IPlugin which <SPAN LANG="en">is responsible
for basic plugin's functionality (a lot of plugins have only that
interface, but this is not a requirement). </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>To finish with
general interfaces hierarchy is IProvider, a kind of 'main' plugin in
Firebird API. IProvider is derived from IPlugin and implemented by
any provider (i.e. if you want to write your own provider you must
implement IProvider) and also implemented by YValve. It's
implementation from YValve which is returned to the user when
getDispatcher() function from master interface is called. IProvider
contains functions making it possible to create an attachment to
database (attach and create) or attach to services manager.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Questions and answers.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Q. We access new
API using IMaster. But how to get access to IMaster itself?</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>A. This is done
using the only one new API function fb_get_master_interface(). It's
exported by fbclient library.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>Q. It's said in
this document that COM-based interfaces are not used in order not to
work with IUnknown methods and that this is done due to performance
issues. But instead you have to upgrade interfaces. Why is it faster
than using IUnknown?</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4>A. Upgrading
interface certainly requires some job to do. In a case when version
matches caller's requirements it's not too big &ndash; just check it,
when real upgrade is needed more CPU cycles will be spent. The main
difference with COM approach is that upgrade performed for interface
only once, after it's creation, but IUnknown methods must be called
each time we are going to call an interface with unknown version (or
that version should be stored separately and later checked). For once
upgraded Firebird interface there is absolutely no waste of time when
performing calls to it during all it's lifetime.</FONT></P>
