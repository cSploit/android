firebird.conf
=============

Firebird configuration can be changed by entries in the firebird.conf.

Depending on operating system this file is found in a little
bit of different ways.


Windows
-------
On Windows this file is located by first looking inside the registry
for a string value specifying the directory of firebird.conf:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Firebird Project\Firebird Server\Instances\DefaultInstance

If this value is not present, it assumes firebird.conf is placed in the
directory directly above the fbserver.exe. If fbserver.exe is placed as

	 C:\Program Files\Firebird\bin\fbserver.exe

then the firebird.conf file is

	C:\Program Files\Firebird\firebird.conf


POSIX (excluding Darwin/Mac OS X)
---------------------------------
For POSIX systems it first tries the "directory above" approach,
described above. If that fails (note: how could this be???) it
then tries to find the directory from the environment variable
FIREBIRD.
If that fails, it tries to find it inside "/usr/local/firebird".

Darwin
------
Darwin on the other hand first checks the environment variable
FIREBIRD. If not found, it [... John, please describe the "bundle"
stuff here].
As a last resort it too falls back to "/usr/local/firebird".


Syntax of firebird.conf
=======================

Comments
--------
The # character is used for comments and can be placed anywhere on a line.
Anything following the # character on a line is considered a comment.
Examples:

# This is a comment
DefaultDbCachePages = 2048   # This is an end-of-line comment


Configuration settings
----------------------

Configuration settings are placed one at each line, followed by zero or
more whitespace (tab or space) characters, a '=' character, followed by
again any number of whitespace, followed by the configuration value.

Example:

DefaultDbCachePages=2048
CpuAffinityMask    =  2  # only run on second CPU

Configuration settings can also be indented on a line by any number of
tabs or spaces. Example:

    DefaultDbCachePages = 2048  # This is also a legal config setting



There are as of this writing, 28 Feb. 2003, 35 user settings. Not all
settings apply to all operating systems.


There are three types of configuration values: integer, boolean and string.


Integers
--------
Integers is what they sound like, an integral value. Examples:
  1
  42
  4711

Boolean
-------
Boolean is expressed as integer values with 0 being "false" and
anything != 0 is taken to mean "true". For consistency we recommend
you only use 0/1

String
------
Strings are also what they sound like, strings. Examples:
RootDirectory  = /opt/firebird
RemotePipeName = "pipe47"


Configuration options
---------------------

RootDirectory              string

SortMemBlockSize           integer  default 1048576 (1 MB)

SortMemUpperLimit          integer
Defaults: Superserver (SS), 67108864 (64 MB). Classic server (CS), 0.

RemoteFileOpenAbility      boolean  default false.
(experimental?) Allow DB files used over NFS mounts.

GuardianOption             integer  default 1
Affects the operation of the guardian:
0 - only start the Firebird service once.
1 - restart the Firebird service if it should terminate.

CpuAffinityMask            integer  default 1
A bit-field defining what CPU's the process should be allowed to run on.
Only meaningful for Windows SS on SMP systems.

OldParameterOrdering       boolean  default false
TcpRemoteBufferSize        integer  default 8192 (bytes)
TcpNoNagle                 boolean  default false
IpcMapSize                 integer  default 4096 (bytes)
DefaultDbCachePages        integer  default SS: 2048. CS: 75
ConnectionTimeout          integer  default 180 (seconds)
DummyPacketInterval        integer  default  60 (seconds)
LockMemSize                integer  default 262144 (256 KB)
LockSemCount               integer  default SINIX-Z: 25. All others: 32
LockSignal                 integer  default 16 (signal # - (only used on POSIX CS?))
LockGrantOrder             boolean  default true
LockHashSlots              integer  default 101
LockRequireSpins           boolean  default false
EventMemSize               integer  default 65536
DeadlockTimeout            integer  default 10 (seconds)
SolarisStallValue          integer  default 60 (seconds)
TraceMemoryPools           boolean  default false
PrioritySwitchDelay        integer  default 100 (milliseconds)
DeadThreadsCollection      integer  default 50
PriorityBoost              integer  default 5
RemoteServiceName          string   default gds_db
RemoteServicePort          integer  default 3050 (TCP port number)
RemotePipeName             string   default "interbas" (Windows only?)
IpcName                    string   default "FirebirdIPI" (Windows only)

MaxUnflushedWrites         integer
# of writes before file writes are forcibly synched.
Windows default: 100. All else -1 (i.e. don't forcibly synch)

MaxUnflushedWriteTime      integer
Windows default:   5. All else -1 (i.e. don't forcibly synch)

ProcessPriorityLevel       integer  default 0 - meaning depends on system.
CreateInternalWindow       boolean  default true
Windows only. Tells if the Firebird server should create a (hidden) window
(used for IPC?) or not.

CompleteBooleanEvaluation  boolean  default off

Controls whether full evaluation of OR and AND statements is performed.
If your SQL code depends on side-effects of full evaluation of
right-hand-side terms, even if the expressions final result could
be determined by just examining the value of the first term, you
might need to turn this on.
