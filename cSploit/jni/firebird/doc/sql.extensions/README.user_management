   Implements capability to manage users from regular database attachment.

Syntax is:

   CREATE USER name {PASSWORD 'password'} [ options ] [ TAGS ( tag [, tag [, tag ...]] ) ]
   ALTER USER name SET [PASSWORD 'password'] [ options ] [ TAGS ( tag [, tag [, tag ...]] ) ]
   ALTER CURRENT USER SET [PASSWORD 'password'] [ options ] [ TAGS ( tag [, tag [, tag ...]] ) ]
   CREATE OR ALTER USER name SET [PASSWORD 'password'] [ options ] [ TAGS ( tag [, tag [, tag ...]] ) ]
   DROP USER name;

where OPTIONS is a (probably empty) list of following options:
- FIRSTNAME 'firstname'
- MIDDLENAME 'middlename'
- LASTNAME 'lastname'
- ACTIVE
- INACTIVE

and each TAG may have one of two forms:
 name = 'string value'
  or:
 DROP name
where NAME is any valid SQL identifier.


Description:

Makes it possible to add, modify and delete users in security database using SQL language.

Firebird since version 3.0 supports multiple security databases. gsec utility and services API
do not support it and use of them to manage users is deprecated. 

CREATE and DROP clauses are available only for SYSDBA (or other user, granted RDB$ADMIN role in
security database). Ordinary user can ALTER his own password, wide names and tags. Attempt to modify
another user will fail. Also will fail an attempt to make yourself inactive or active. In order to
avoid typing your name each time simplified form ALTER CURRENT USER is present.

At least one of PASSWORD, FIRSTNAME, MIDDLENAME, LASTNAME, ACTIVE, INACTIVE or TAGS must be present
in ALTER USER statement. Also notice that PASSWORD clause is required when creating new user.

PASSWORD clause is enough self-descripting. Clauses FIRSTNAME, MIDDLENAME and LASTNAME too, but may
be also used to store any short information about user. Clauses INACTIVE/ACTIVE are used to disable
user's login to server not dropping it from the list and restoring that ability.

TAGS is a list of end-user defined attributes. Length of the value should not exceed 255 bytes.
Assigning name some value sets new or modifies existing tag. To remove the tag use DROP option.
Setting a list of tags for the user keeps earlier set tags if they are not mentioned currently.
Notice - UID/GID, entered by deprecated gsec, are treated as tags in SQL interface.

To access list of users please select from virtual tables SEC$USERS and SEC$USER_ATTRIBUTES.


Samples:

 Generic:
   CREATE USER alex PASSWORD 'test';
   ALTER USER alex SET FIRSTNAME 'Alex' LASTNAME 'Peshkoff';
   CREATE OR ALTER USER alex SET PASSWORD 'IdQfA';
   DROP USER alex;
   ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD 'SomethingLongEnough';

 Working with tags:
   ALTER USER alex SET TAGS (a='a', b='b');
	NAME             VALUE
	================ ============================== 
	A                a
	B                b

   ALTER USER alex SET TAGS (b='x', c='d');
	NAME             VALUE
	================ ============================== 
	A                a
	B                x
	C                d

   ALTER USER alex SET TAGS (drop a, c='sample');
	NAME             VALUE
	================ ============================== 
	B                x
	C                sample

 Displaying users' list:
  SELECT CAST(U.SEC$USER_NAME AS CHAR(20)) LOGIN,
    CAST(A.SEC$KEY AS CHAR(10)) TAG,
    CAST(A.SEC$VALUE AS CHAR(20)) "VALUE"
  FROM SEC$USERS U LEFT JOIN SEC$USER_ATTRIBUTES A
    ON U.SEC$USER_NAME = A.SEC$USER_NAME;

   LOGIN                TAG        VALUE
   ==================== ========== ====================
   SYSDBA               <null>     <null>
   ALEX                 B          x
   ALEX                 C          sample


Notice!
This feature highly depends upon user management plugin. Take into an account that some options
are ignored when using legacy user management plugin.
