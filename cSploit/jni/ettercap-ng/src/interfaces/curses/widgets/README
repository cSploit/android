I've started to write this library to "make the things easier" for me while
coding the ettercap NG curses interface.
While coding this collection of widgets, I've decided to make it a separate
library from ettercap, and I've removed any dependency on it. Only the
configure script is shared.

Someday, probably I'll distribute this library as a separate project. For now,
I don't have time to maintain another projects with all the consequences that
this implies.

No documentation is provided, sorry. But if you understand how to use these
functions looking at the ettercap code, you can use the library in your own
projects. Drop me an email if you are interested in this project.
