/** 
 * @mainpage Libnet Packet Assembly Library
 *
 * @section intro Overview
 *
 * Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application programmer to 
 * construct and inject network packets. It provides a portable and simplified 
 * interface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. 
 * Libnet hides much of the tedium of packet creation from the application 
 * programmer such as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header 
 * information, byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet 
 * features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer,
 * as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality. Using 
 * libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with
 * little effort. With a bit more time, more complex programs can be written 
 * (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten using libnet and 
 * <a href="www.tcpdump.org">libpcap</a>).
