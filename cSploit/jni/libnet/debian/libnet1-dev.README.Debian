 From what I've seen in the libnet mailing list, the current libnet
package still has documentation and function export issues:

 - if that function is only used internally, it should not be exported
   in the header file
 - the HTML documentation seems to refer to the old API of libnet
 - I've later found out that the manpage suggests to create many libnet
   contexts if one wants to create many packets at a time; although I
   don't really like that idea, there is a documented way of doing it
   and many packets can be created without using libnet_pblock_coalesce
 - In the mailing list, sandr8 suggests to use libnet_adv_cull_packet(),
   however that function is not documented in the manpage, but only as a
   short comment in the header file, which doesn't tell how and if the
   resulting packet should be deallocated
 - In the mailing list, sandr8 and Mike Schiffman suggest using the
   context queue interface, for which I haven't found any documented
   overview on what its concepts are, but only the single functions
   briefly documented in the header file
 - Mike Schiffman also talks about initializing libnet with the ADVANCED
   interface, but again I only found the LIBNET_????_ADV constants
   briefly documented, with no overview on what the advanced mode is and
   does
