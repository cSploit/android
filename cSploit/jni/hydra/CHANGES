   ! Windows release (cygwin compile with dll's)
   ! PalmPilot release
   ! ARM processor release (for all your Zaurus, iPaq etc. running Linux)
* There are new service attack modules:
   ! ms-sql
   ! sap r/3 (requires a library)
   ! ssh v2 (requires a library)
* Enhancements/Fixes to service attack modules:
   ! vnc module didnt work correctly, fixed
   ! mysql module supports newer versions now
   ! http module received a minor fix and has better virtual host support now
   ! http-proxy supports now an optional URL
   ! socks5 checks now for false positives and daemons without authentication
* The core code (hydra.c) was rewritten from scratch
   ! rewrote the internal distribution functions from scratch. code is now
     safer, less error prone, easier to read.
   ! multiple target support rewritten which now includes intelligent load
     balancing based on success, error and load rate
   ! intelligently detect maximum connect numbers for services (per server if
     multiple targets are used)
   ! intelligent restore file writing
   ! Faster (up to 15%)
   ! Full Cygwin and Cygwin IPv6 support
* added new tool: pw-inspector - it can be used to just try passwords which
