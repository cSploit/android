.SH DESCRIPTION
Hydra is a parallized login cracker which supports numerous protocols
to attack. New modules are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and
very fast.

This tool gives researchers and security consultants the possiblity to
show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a
system.

Currently this tool supports:
 AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, FTPS, 
 HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-PROXY,
 HTTP-PROXY-URLENUM, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP2, LDAP3, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP,
 Oracle, Oracle-Listener, Oracle-SID, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES,
 RDP, REXEC, RLOGIN, RSH, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP-Enum, SNMP,
 SOCKS5, SSH(v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet,
 VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.
 For most protocols, SSL mode is available (e.g. https-get, ftp-ssl, etc.)
 If not all necessary libraries are found during compile time, your
 available services will be less. Type "hydra" to see what is available.
.SH Options
.TP
.B target
a target to attack, can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address or DNS name.
.TP
.B service
a service to attack, see the list of protocols available
.TP
.B OPTIONAL SERVICE PARAMETER
Some modules have optional or mandatory options. type "hydra \-U <servicename>"
 to get help on on the options of a service.
.TP
.B \-R 
restore a previously aborted session. Requires a hydra.restore file was
written. No other options are allowed when using \-R
.TP
.B \-S
connect via SSL
.TP
.B \-s PORT
if the service is on a different default port, define it here
.TP
.B \-l LOGIN
or \-L FILE login with LOGIN name, or load several logins from FILE
.TP
.B \-p PASS
or \-P FILE try password PASS, or load several passwords from FILE
.TP
.B \-x min:max:charset
generate passwords from min to max length. charset can contain 1
 for numbers, a for lowcase and A for upcase characters.
 Any other character is added is put to the list. 
   Example: 1:2:a1%.
   The generated passwords will be of length 1 to 2 and contain
   lowcase letters, numbers and/or percent signs and dots.
.TP
.B \-e nsr
additional checks, "n" for null password, "s" try login as pass, "r" try the reverse login as pass
.TP
.B \-C FILE
colon separated "login:pass" format, instead of \-L/\-P options
.TP
.B \-u
by default Hydra checks all passwords for one login and then tries the next
login. This option loops around the passwords, so the first password is
tried on all logins, then the next password.
.TP
.B \-f
exit after the first found login/password pair (per host if \-M)
.TP
.B \-F
exit after the first found login/password pair for any host (for usage with -M)
.TP
.B \-M FILE
server list for parallel attacks, one entry per line
.TP
.B \-o FILE
write found login/password pairs to FILE instead of stdout
.TP
.B \-t TASKS
run TASKS number of connects in parallel (default: 16)
.TP
.B \-w TIME
defines the max wait time in seconds for responses (default: 32)
.TP
.B \-W TIME
defines a wait time between each connection a task performs. This usually
only makes sense if a low task number is used, .e.g \-t 1
.TP
.B \-4 / \-6 
prefer IPv4 (default) or IPv6 addresses
.TP
.B \-v / \-V 
verbose mode / show login+pass combination for each attempt
.B \-d
debug mode
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
