.SH DESCRIPTION
Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols
to attack. New modules are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and
very fast.
.LP
This tool gives researchers and security consultants the possibility to
show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a
system.
.TP
Currently this tool supports:
adam6500 afp asterisk cisco cisco-enable cvs firebird ftp ftps
http[s]-{head|get|post} http[s]-{get|post}-form http-proxy
http-proxy-urlenum icq imap[s] irc ldap2[s]
ldap3[-{cram|digest}md5][s] mssql mysql(v4) mysql5 ncp nntp
oracle oracle-listener oracle-sid pcanywhere pcnfs pop3[s]
postgres rdp radmin2 redis rexec rlogin rpcap rsh rtsp s7-300 sapr3 sip
smb smtp[s] smtp-enum snmp socks5 ssh sshkey svn teamspeak telnet[s]
vmauthd vnc xmpp
.LP
For most protocols SSL is supported (e.g. https-get, ftp-ssl, etc.).
If not all necessary libraries are found during compile time, your
available services will be less.
Type "hydra" to see what is available.
.SH Options
.TP
.B target
a target to attack, can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address or DNS name.
.TP
.B service
a service to attack, see the list of protocols available
.TP
.B OPTIONAL SERVICE PARAMETER
Some modules have optional or mandatory options. type "hydra \-U <servicename>"
 to get help on on the options of a service.
.TP
.B \-R 
restore a previously aborted session. Requires a hydra.restore file was
written. Options are restored, but can be changed by setting them after
\-R on the command line
.TP
.B \-S
connect via SSL
.TP
.TP
.B \-O
use old SSL v2 and v3
.TP
.B \-s PORT
if the service is on a different default port, define it here
.TP
.B \-l LOGIN
or \-L FILE login with LOGIN name, or load several logins from FILE
.TP
.B \-p PASS
or \-P FILE try password PASS, or load several passwords from FILE
.TP
.B \-x min:max:charset
generate passwords from min to max length. charset can contain 1
 for numbers, a for lowcase and A for upcase characters.
 Any other character is added is put to the list. 
   Example: 1:2:a1%.
   The generated passwords will be of length 1 to 2 and contain
   lowcase letters, numbers and/or percent signs and dots.
.TP
.B \-y
disable use of symbols in \-x bruteforce, see above
.TP
.B \-e nsr
additional checks, "n" for null password, "s" try login as pass, "r" try the reverse login as pass
.TP
.B \-C FILE
colon separated "login:pass" format, instead of \-L/\-P options
.TP
.B \-u
by default Hydra checks all passwords for one login and then tries the next
login. This option loops around the passwords, so the first password is
tried on all logins, then the next password.
.TP
.B \-f
exit after the first found login/password pair (per host if \-M)
.TP
.B \-F
exit after the first found login/password pair for any host (for usage with \-M)
.TP
.B \-M FILE
server list for parallel attacks, one entry per line
.TP
.B \-o FILE
write found login/password pairs to FILE instead of stdout
.TP
.B \-b FORMAT
specify the format for the \-o FILE: text(default), json, jsonv1
.TP
.B \-t TASKS
run TASKS number of connects in parallel (default: 16)
.TP
.B \-m OPTIONS
module specific options. See hydra -U <module> what options are available.
.TP
.B \-w TIME
defines the max wait time in seconds for responses (default: 32)
.TP
.B \-W TIME
defines a wait time between each connection a task performs. This usually
only makes sense if a low task number is used, .e.g \-t 1
.TP
.B \-c TIME
the wait time in seconds per login attempt over all threads (-t 1 is recommended)
This usually only makes sense if a low task number is used, .e.g \-t 1
.TP
.B \-4 / \-6 
prefer IPv4 (default) or IPv6 addresses
.TP
.B \-v / \-V 
verbose mode / show login+pass combination for each attempt
.TP
.B \-d
debug mode
.TP
.B \-I
ignore an existing restore file (don't wait 10 seconds)
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
