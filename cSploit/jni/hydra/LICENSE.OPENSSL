Certain source files in this program permit linking with the OpenSSL
library (http://www.openssl.org), which otherwise wouldn't be allowed
under the GPL.  For purposes of identifying OpenSSL, most source files
giving this permission limit it to versions of OpenSSL having a license
identical to that listed in this file (LICENSE.OpenSSL).  It is not
necessary for the copyright years to match between this file and the
OpenSSL version in question.  However, note that because this file is
an extension of the license statements of these source files, this file
may not be changed except with permission from all copyright holders
of source files in this program which reference this file.


  LICENSE ISSUES
  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
