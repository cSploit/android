  <title>HTTP Client Security</title>

  <para>&neon; is intended to be secure against a specific threat
  model: use of a malicious HTTP server.  Under this threat model, a
  range of attacks are possible against a client when the user (or
  application) can be tricked into accessing an HTTP server which is
  controlled by an attacker.  This section documents various types of
  possible attack and describes what mitigation is used in
  &neon;.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>CPU or memory consumption attacks</title>

    <para>&neon; uses fixed resource limits to prevent the following
    attacks:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>memory/CPU consumption attack using an unbounded number
        of response header fields</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>memory consumption attack using an unbounded length of
        individual response header lines (or continuation
        headers)</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>memory consumption attack against the PROPFIND code
        using an unbounded number of properties (propstat elements)
        per resource</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>memory consumption attack against the PROPFIND code
        using an unbounded CDATA element in a "flat property"
        value</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Memory consumption attacks against applications based on
    &neon; by use of unbounded response length are also possible, but
    must be mitigated at application level.  Memory consumption in
    &neon; itself is fixed and is not proportional to the response
    size.</para>

    <para>Test cases for all the above attacks are present in the
    &neon; test suite.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>SSL/TLS connection security</title>
    
    <para>When using a connection secured by SSL/TLS, it is necessary
    for clients to verify that the X.509 certificate presented by the
    server matches the server's expected identity.  The algorithm
    required for this purpose is described in RFC 2818 and RFC 3280,
    and is implemented by &neon; in the following manner:</para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>the hostname argument passed to <xref
        linkend="ne_session_create"/> is the expected identity of the
        server</para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
        <para>the subjectAltName extension of the certificate is used
        for comparision against the expected identity, in preference
        to the Subject name's commonName attribute.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the dNSName, iPAddress, and uniformResourceIdentifier
        classes of GeneralName are supported in subjectAltName
        comparison.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>if no subjectAltName is present in the certificate, the
        most specific commonName attribute in the Subject name is used
        for comparison instead.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist> 
    
    <para>In the case where a server certificate is presented that
    does not match the expected identity (or is otherwise not
    trusted), &neon; will fail the request by default.  This behaviour
    can be overridden by the use of a callback installed using <xref
    linkend="ne_ssl_set_verify"/>, which allows the application to
    present the certificate details to a user for manual/off-line
    verification, if possible.</para>
  
    <para>Test cases for the correctness of the implementation of the
    identity verification algorithm are present in the &neon; test
    suite.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Control character insertion in error messages</title>
    
    <para>Where error messages (as returned by
    (<xref linkend="ne_get_error"/>) contain data supplied by the
    server, the untrusted data is sanitised to remove both control
    characters and non-ASCII characters.  This prevents any attacks
    where such error messages are exposed to the user and can
    potentially distort the presentation of the interface (for
    example, through the use of a carriage return character in a text
    user interface).</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Attacks against authentication credentials</title>
    
    <para>Authentication credentials can be compromised by a
    "downgrade attack" by an active attacker; for example, where a
    MITM presents a Basic authentication challenge in place of the
    server's Digest challenge.  &neon; mitigates these attacks by
    allowing the application (and hence, user) to specify that only a
    specific set of authentication protocols is permitted.</para>

    <para>&neon; supports the Digest and Negotiate authentication
    schemes, which both allow authentication of users without passing
    credentials in cleartext over the wire.  The "domain" parameter is
    supported in Digest, allowing the server to restrict an
    authentication session to a particular set of URIs.</para>
