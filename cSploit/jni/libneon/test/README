Stupidly Simple Test Suite for neon
-----------------------------------

The aim of the test suite is two-fold:

 1. ensure compliance to the relevant RFCs in network behaviour.

 2. ensure that the promises made by the public API are met 
 by the current implementation.

The file `STATUS' makes an attempt at listing RFC requirements and how
the test suite tests whether neon meets them or not (it's not finished
yet).

The test suite is licensed under the GPL.

Important Note About Test Failures
----------------------------------

Note that a test failure either means a bug in the test or a bug in
the code itself.  On platforms without pipe(), there is a race
condition in the code which forks a server process: if you get random
failures on a slow or loaded box, increase the sleep time in
common/child.c:minisleep().

Extra Stuff
-----------

server-tests requires that you have a running HTTP server on localhost
port 80, and you have copied htdocs/* to server-htdocs-root/test/*

This test suite is inspired by the Subversion project, discussion on
the subversion mailing list, and seeing chromatic's talks on XP.  The
presentation is inspired by the standard Perl test suite.  Imitation
is the greatest form of flattery, right?
