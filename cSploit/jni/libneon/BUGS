Known problems/bugs in neon                                      -*- text -*-
---------------------------

* several reports of issues with long-lived sessions causing problems
 with GSSAPI auth using mod_auth_kerb.  May be a server problem, but
 needs further investigation to be sure. 

* 2818 requires that a on rejection of the SSL server cert, a "bad certificate"
 message should be sent - this is not being done currently (and can probably
 only be done with OpenSSL by actually doing cert verification in the verify
 callback)

* ne_lock_discover does not handle multiple (shared) locks on
  a single resource.

* SSL session caching issues; only cache for clean shutdowns, and
 only cache on shutdown, since the SSL_SESSION may change during
 an ne_session?

* perhaps allow a per-Server-header hack for "Darwin Streaming Server
4.0" which doesn't terminate the response headers:
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366331

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Darwin Streaming Server 4.0
Content-Type: audio/mpeg
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Connection: close
W8޳����s0��

* for a server with multiple A addresses, a successful connect() will
  "pin" that address for future attempts to connect.  If subsequently
  a connect() fails, neon should at least iterate through the entire
  address list and at best should do the DNS lookup again.

* should 207 code strclean the error string from the response body?

* load_client_cert fails with:

  load_client_cert: (did not fail to load clicert without pkey)

  on RHEL4 openssl.

* --with-ca-bundle only allows trusting a PEM bundle; support
  by directory as well
