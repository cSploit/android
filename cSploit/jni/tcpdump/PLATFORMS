In many operating systems tcpdump is available as a native package or port,
which simplifies installation of updates and long-term maintenance. However,
the native packages are sometimes a few versions behind and to try a more
recent snapshot it will take to compile tcpdump from the source code.

tcpdump compiles and works on at least the following platforms:

* AIX
* FreeBSD
* HP-UX 11i
* Linux (any) with glibc (usually just works)
* Linux (any) with musl libc (sometimes fails to compile, please report any bugs)
* Mac OS X / macOS
* NetBSD
* OpenWrt
* Solaris
