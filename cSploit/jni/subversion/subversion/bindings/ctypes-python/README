BUILDING CSVN
-------------

Before building csvn, first verify that you have all the required software
installed:

  - Python 2.4 or later
  - ctypes 1.0 or later (NOTE: ctypes is included by default with Python 2.5)
  - Subversion 1.4.3 or later (including header files)
  - APR and APR-util (including header files, and the
                      apr-1-config / apr-config script)

Next, checkout the latest version of ctypesgen from
http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/ to a "ctypesgen" subdirectory under
the ctypes python bindings.

For example:
   $ svn co http://ctypesgen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk ctypesgen

Once you have all of the above software installed, you can build the
ctypes Python bindings by running the following:

python setup.py build --apr=<path> --apr-util=<path> --subversion=<path> \
--ctypesgen=<path>

If you're having problems getting the right path specified for any of the
options above, or you'd like a full list of options which can be passed to
the setup.py build command, feel free to run "python setup.py build --help".

------------
TESTING CSVN
------------

You can test the bindings by running test/run_all.py. The output of
test/run_all.py should look something like this:

   $ python test/run_all.py

   Ran 26 tests in 51.456s

   OK

---------------
INSTALLING CSVN
---------------

One you have built the ctypes python bindings using "python setup.py build ..."
you can then install the bindings using the "python setup.py install" command.
This command, by default, will install the ctypes-python-bindings into your
Python's site-packages but if you'd like to install elsewhere, feel free to run
"python setup.py install --help" to get a list of options that will help you
install the ctypes-python-bindings wherever and however you'd like.
