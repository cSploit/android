   Format 3 was current for 1.0 through to 1.3.

   Format 4 was an abortive experiment during the development of the

   Format 5 was new in 1.4, and is the first format which may contain
   BDB or FSFS filesystems with a FS format other than 1, since prior
   formats are accepted by some versions of Subversion which do not
   pay attention to the FS format number.
