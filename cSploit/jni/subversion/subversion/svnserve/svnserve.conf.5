.SH NAME
svnserve.conf \- Repository configuration file for svnserve
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fIrepository-path\fP\fB/conf/svnserve.conf\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsvnserve.conf\fP controls the behavior of the \fBsvnserve\fP daemon
on a per-repository basis.  It is located in the \fBconf\fP
subdirectory of the repository.
.PP
The overall structure of the file is the same as the structure of
Subversion user configuration files.  At the top level are sections,
which are specified by words in square brackets; inside each section
are variable definitions of the form "variable = value".  Lines
beginning with '#' are ignored.  \fBsvnserve.conf\fP currently uses
only one section named "general", and supports the following
variables:
.PP
.TP 5
\fBanon-access\fP = \fBnone\fP|\fBread\fP|\fBwrite\fP
Determines the access level for unauthenticated users.  \fBwrite\fP
access allows all repository operations.  \fBread\fP access allows all
operations except committing and changing revision properties.
\fBnone\fP access allows no access.  The default level is \fBread\fP.
.PP
.TP 5
\fBauth-access\fP = \fBnone\fP|\fBread\fP|\fBwrite\fP
Determines the access level for authenticated users, using the same
access levels as above.  The default level is \fBwrite\fP.
.PP
.TP 5
\fBpassword-db\fP = \fIfilename\fP
Sets the location of the password database.  \fIfilename\fP may be
relative to the repository conf directory.  There is no default value.
The password database has the same overall format as this file.  It
uses only one section "users"; each variable within the section is a
username, and each value is a password.
.PP
.TP 5
\fBauthz-db\fP = \fIfilename\fP
The authz-db option controls the location of the authorization
rules for path-based access control.  \fIfilename\fP may be 
relative to the repository conf directory.  There is no default value.
If you don't specify an authz-db, no path-based access control is done.
.PP
.TP 5
\fBrealm\fP = \fIrealm\-name\fP
Sets the authentication realm of the repository.  If two repositories
have the same password database, they should have the same realm, and
vice versa; this association allows clients to use a single cached
password for several repositories.  The default realm value is the
repository's uuid.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example \fBsvnserve.conf\fP allows read access for
authenticated users, no access for anonymous users, points to a passwd
database in the same directory, and defines a realm name.
.PP
.nf
 [general]
 anon-access = none
 auth-access = read
 password-db = passwd
 realm = My First Repository
.fi
.PP
The file "passwd" would look like:
.PP
.nf
 [users]
 joeuser = joepassword
 jayrandom = randomjay
.fi
