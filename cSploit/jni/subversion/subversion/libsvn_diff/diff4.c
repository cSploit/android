/*
 * In the text below consider the following:
 *
 * O     = Original
 * M     = Modified
 * L     = Latest
 * A     = Ancestor
 * X:Y   = diff between X and Y
 * X:Y:Z = 3-way diff between X, Y and Z
 * P     = O:L, possibly adjusted
 *
 * diff4 -- Variance adjusted diff algorithm
 *
 * 1. Create a diff O:L and call that P.
 *
 * 2. Morph P into a 3-way diff by performing the following
 *    transformation: O:L -> O:O:L.
 *
 * 3. Create a diff A:O.
 *
 * 4. Using A:O...
 *
 * #. Using M:A...
 *
 * #. Resolve conflicts...
 *

   1. Out-range added line: decrement the line numbers in every hunk in P
      that comes after the addition. This undoes the effect of the add, since
      the add never happened in D.

   2. Out-range deleted line: increment the line numbers in every hunk in P
      that comes after the deletion. This undoes the effect of the deletion,
      since the deletion never happened in D.

   3. Out-range edited line: do nothing. Out-range edits are irrelevant to P.

   4. Added line in context range in P: remove the corresponding line from
      the context, optionally replacing it with new context based on that
      region in M, and adjust line numbers and mappings appropriately.

   5. Added line in affected text range in P: this is a dependency problem
      -- part of the change T:18-T:19 depends on changes introduced to T after
      B branched. There are several possible behaviors, depending on what the
      user wants. One is to generate an informative error, stating that
      T:18-T:19 depends on some other change (T:N-T:M, where N>=8, M<=18,
      and M-N == 1); the exact revisions can be discovered automatically using
      the same process as "cvs annotate", though it may take some time to do
      so. Another option is to include the change in P, as an insertion of the
      "after" version of the text, and adjust line numbers and mappings
      accordingly. (And if all this isn't sounding a lot like a directory
      merge algorithm, try drinking more of the Kool-Aid.) A third option is
      to include it as an insertion, but with metadata (such as CVS-style
      conflict markers) indicating that the line attempting to be patched
      does not exist in B.

   6. Deleted line that is in-range in P: request another universe -- this
      situation can't happen in ours.

   7. In-range edited line: reverse that edit in the "before" version of the
      corresponding line in the appropriate hunk in P, to obtain the version of
      the line that will be found in B when P is applied.
