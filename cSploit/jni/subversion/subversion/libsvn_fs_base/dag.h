/* The interface in this file provides all the essential filesystem
   operations, but exposes the filesystem's DAG structure.  This makes
   it simpler to implement than the public interface, since a client
   of this interface has to understand and cope with shared structure
   directly as it appears in the database.  However, it's still a
   self-consistent set of invariants to maintain, making it
   (hopefully) a useful interface boundary.

   In other words:

   - The dag_node_t interface exposes the internal DAG structure of
     the filesystem, while the svn_fs.h interface does any cloning
     necessary to make the filesystem look like a tree.

   - The dag_node_t interface exposes the existence of copy nodes,
     whereas the svn_fs.h handles them transparently.

   - dag_node_t's must be explicitly cloned, whereas the svn_fs.h
     operations make clones implicitly.

   - Callers of the dag_node_t interface use Berkeley DB transactions
     to ensure consistency between operations, while callers of the
     svn_fs.h interface use Subversion transactions.  */
