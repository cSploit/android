/* Newline and keyword translation properties */

/* If EOL is not-NULL query the SVN_PROP_EOL_STYLE property on file
   LOCAL_ABSPATH in DB.  If STYLE is non-null, set *STYLE to LOCAL_ABSPATH's
   eol style.  Set *EOL to

      - NULL for svn_subst_eol_style_none, or

      - a null-terminated C string containing the native eol marker
        for this platform, for svn_subst_eol_style_native, or

      - a null-terminated C string containing the eol marker indicated
        by the property value, for svn_subst_eol_style_fixed.

   If STYLE is null on entry, ignore it.  If *EOL is non-null on exit,
   it is a static string not allocated in POOL.

   If KEYWORDS is not NULL Expand keywords for the file at LOCAL_ABSPATH
   in DB, by parsing a whitespace-delimited list of keywords.  If any keywords
   are found in the list, allocate *KEYWORDS from RESULT_POOL and populate it
   with mappings from (const char *) keywords to their (svn_string_t *)
   values (also allocated in RESULT_POOL).

   If a keyword is in the list, but no corresponding value is
   available, do not create a hash entry for it.  If no keywords are
   found in the list, or if there is no list, set *KEYWORDS to NULL.

   If SPECIAL is not NULL determine if the svn:special flag is set on
   LOCAL_ABSPATH in DB.  If so, set SPECIAL to TRUE, if not, set it to FALSE.

   If PROPS is not NULL, use PROPS instead of the properties on LOCAL_ABSPATH.

   If WRI_ABSPATH is not NULL, retrieve the information for LOCAL_ABSPATH
   from the working copy identified by WRI_ABSPATH. Falling back to file
   external information if the file is not present as versioned node.

   If FOR_NORMALIZATION is TRUE, just return a list of keywords instead of
   calculating their intended values.

   Use SCRATCH_POOL for temporary allocation, RESULT_POOL for allocating
   *STYLE and *EOL.
