       definition with something easier to comprehend.

   What the callers want:
     A path to a file that will remain available and unchanged as long as
     the caller wants it - such as for the lifetime of RESULT_POOL.

   What the current implementation provides:
     A path to the file in the pristine store.  This file will be removed or
     replaced the next time this or another Subversion client updates the WC.

   If the node LOCAL_ABSPATH has no such pristine text, return an error of
   type SVN_ERR_WC_PATH_UNEXPECTED_STATUS.
