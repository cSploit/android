/**
   Given an apache request @a r, a @a uri, and a @a root_path to the svn
   location block, process @a uri and return many things, allocated in
   @a r->pool:

   - @a cleaned_uri:    The uri with duplicate and trailing slashes removed.

   - @a trailing_slash: Whether the uri had a trailing slash on it.

   Three special substrings of the uri are returned for convenience:

   - @a repos_basename: The single path component that is the directory
                      which contains the repository.  (Don't confuse
                      this with the "repository name" as optionally
                      defined via the SVNReposName directive!)

   - @a relative_path:  The remaining imaginary path components.

   - @a repos_path:     The actual path within the repository filesystem, or
                      NULL if no part of the uri refers to a path in
                      the repository (e.g. "!svn/vcc/default" or
                      "!svn/bln/25").


   For example, consider the uri

       /svn/repos/proj1/!svn/blah/13//A/B/alpha

   In the SVNPath case, this function would receive a @a root_path of
   '/svn/repos/proj1', and in the SVNParentPath case would receive a
   @a root_path of '/svn/repos'.  But either way, we would get back:

     - @a cleaned_uri:    /svn/repos/proj1/!svn/blah/13/A/B/alpha
     - @a repos_basename: proj1
     - @a relative_path:  /!svn/blah/13/A/B/alpha
     - @a repos_path:     A/B/alpha
     - @a trailing_slash: FALSE
