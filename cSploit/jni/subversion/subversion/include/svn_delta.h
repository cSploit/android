/**  Text deltas.
 *
 * A text delta represents the difference between two strings of
 * bytes, the `source' string and the `target' string.  Given a source
 * string and a target string, we can compute a text delta; given a
 * source string and a delta, we can reconstruct the target string.
 * However, note that deltas are not reversible: you cannot always
 * reconstruct the source string given the target string and delta.
 *
 * Since text deltas can be very large, the interface here allows us
 * to produce and consume them in pieces.  Each piece, represented by
 * an #svn_txdelta_window_t structure, describes how to produce the
 * next section of the target string.
 *
 * To compute a new text delta:
 *
 * - We call svn_txdelta() on the streams we want to compare.  That
 *   returns us an #svn_txdelta_stream_t object.
 *
 * - We then call svn_txdelta_next_window() on the stream object
 *   repeatedly.  Each call returns a new #svn_txdelta_window_t
 *   object, which describes the next portion of the target string.
 *   When svn_txdelta_next_window() returns zero, we are done building
 *   the target string.

/** Traversing tree deltas.
 *
 * In Subversion, we've got various producers and consumers of tree
 * deltas.
 *
 * In processing a `commit' command:
 * - The client examines its working copy data, and produces a tree
 *   delta describing the changes to be committed.
 * - The client networking library consumes that delta, and sends them
 *   across the wire as an equivalent series of network requests (for
 *   example, to svnserve as an ra_svn protocol stream, or to an
 *   Apache httpd server as WebDAV commands)
 * - The server receives those requests and produces a tree delta ---
 *   hopefully equivalent to the one the client produced above.
 * - The Subversion server module consumes that delta and commits an
 *   appropriate transaction to the filesystem.
 *
 * In processing an `update' command, the process is reversed:
 * - The Subversion server module talks to the filesystem and produces
 *   a tree delta describing the changes necessary to bring the
 *   client's working copy up to date.
 * - The server consumes this delta, and assembles a reply
 *   representing the appropriate changes.
 * - The client networking library receives that reply, and produces a
 *   tree delta --- hopefully equivalent to the one the Subversion
 *   server produced above.
 * - The working copy library consumes that delta, and makes the
 *   appropriate changes to the working copy.
 *
 * The simplest approach would be to represent tree deltas using the
 * obvious data structure.  To do an update, the server would
 * construct a delta structure, and the working copy library would
 * apply that structure to the working copy; the network layer's job
 * would simply be to get the structure across the net intact.
 *
 * However, we expect that these deltas will occasionally be too large
 * to fit in a typical workstation's swap area.  For example, in
 * checking out a 200Mb source tree, the entire source tree is
 * represented by a single tree delta.  So it's important to handle
 * deltas that are too large to fit in swap all at once.
 *
 * So instead of representing the tree delta explicitly, we define a
 * standard way for a consumer to process each piece of a tree delta
 * as soon as the producer creates it.  The #svn_delta_editor_t
 * structure is a set of callback functions to be defined by a delta
 * consumer, and invoked by a delta producer.  Each invocation of a
 * callback function describes a piece of the delta --- a file's
 * contents changing, something being renamed, etc.
 *

/** A structure full of callback functions the delta source will invoke
 * as it produces the delta.
 *
 * @note Don't try to allocate one of these yourself.  Instead, always
 * use svn_delta_default_editor() or some other constructor, to ensure
 * that unused slots are filled in with no-op functions.
 *
 * <h3>Function Usage</h3>
 *
 * Here's how to use these functions to express a tree delta.
 *
 * The delta consumer implements the callback functions described in
 * this structure, and the delta producer invokes them.  So the
 * caller (producer) is pushing tree delta data at the callee
 * (consumer).
 *
 * At the start of traversal, the consumer provides @a edit_baton, a
 * baton global to the entire delta edit.  If there is a target
 * revision that needs to be set for this operation, the producer
 * should call the @c set_target_revision function at this point.
 *
 * Next, if there are any tree deltas to express, the producer should
 * pass the @a edit_baton to the @c open_root function, to get a baton
 * representing root of the tree being edited.
 *
 * Most of the callbacks work in the obvious way:
 *
 *     @c delete_entry
 *     @c add_file
 *     @c add_directory
 *     @c open_file
 *     @c open_directory
 *
 * Each of these takes a directory baton, indicating the directory
 * in which the change takes place, and a @a path argument, giving the
 * path (relative to the root of the edit) of the file,
 * subdirectory, or directory entry to change. Editors will usually
 * want to join this relative path with some base stored in the edit
 * baton (e.g. a URL, a location in the OS filesystem).
 *
 * Since every call requires a parent directory baton, including
 * @c add_directory and @c open_directory, where do we ever get our
 * initial directory baton, to get things started?  The @c open_root
 * function returns a baton for the top directory of the change.  In
 * general, the producer needs to invoke the editor's @c open_root
 * function before it can get anything of interest done.
 *
 * While @c open_root provides a directory baton for the root of
 * the tree being changed, the @c add_directory and @c open_directory
 * callbacks provide batons for other directories.  Like the
 * callbacks above, they take a @a parent_baton and a relative path
 * @a path, and then return a new baton for the subdirectory being
 * created / modified --- @a child_baton.  The producer can then use
 * @a child_baton to make further changes in that subdirectory.
 *
 * So, if we already have subdirectories named `foo' and `foo/bar',
 * then the producer can create a new file named `foo/bar/baz.c' by
 * calling:
 *
 *    - @c open_root () --- yielding a baton @a root for the top directory
 *
 *    - @c open_directory (@a root, "foo") --- yielding a baton @a f for `foo'
 *
 *    - @c open_directory (@a f, "foo/bar") --- yielding a baton @a b for
 *      `foo/bar'
 *
 *    - @c add_file (@a b, "foo/bar/baz.c")
 *
 * When the producer is finished making changes to a directory, it
 * should call @c close_directory.  This lets the consumer do any
 * necessary cleanup, and free the baton's storage.
 *
 * The @c add_file and @c open_file callbacks each return a baton
 * for the file being created or changed.  This baton can then be
 * passed to @c apply_textdelta to change the file's contents, or
 * @c change_file_prop to change the file's properties.  When the
 * producer is finished making changes to a file, it should call
 * @c close_file, to let the consumer clean up and free the baton.
 *
 * The @c add_file and @c add_directory functions each take arguments
 * @a copyfrom_path and @a copyfrom_revision.  If @a copyfrom_path is
 * non-@c NULL, then @a copyfrom_path and @a copyfrom_revision indicate where
 * the file or directory should be copied from (to create the file
 * or directory being added).  In that case, @a copyfrom_path must be
 * either a path relative to the root of the edit, or a URI from the
 * repository being edited.  If @a copyfrom_path is @c NULL, then @a
 * copyfrom_revision must be #SVN_INVALID_REVNUM; it is invalid to
 * pass a mix of valid and invalid copyfrom arguments.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Function Call Ordering</h3>
 *
 * There are six restrictions on the order in which the producer
 * may use the batons:
 *
 * 1. The producer may call @c open_directory, @c add_directory,
 *    @c open_file, @c add_file at most once on any given directory
 *    entry.  @c delete_entry may be called at most once on any given
 *    directory entry and may later be followed by @c add_directory or
 *    @c add_file on the same directory entry.  @c delete_entry may
 *    not be called on any directory entry after @c open_directory,
 *    @c add_directory, @c open_file or @c add_file has been called on
 *    that directory entry.
 *
 * 2. The producer may not close a directory baton until it has
 *    closed all batons for its subdirectories.
 *
 * 3. When a producer calls @c open_directory or @c add_directory,
 *    it must specify the most recently opened of the currently open
 *    directory batons.  Put another way, the producer cannot have
 *    two sibling directory batons open at the same time.
 *
 * 4. A producer must call @c change_dir_prop on a directory either
 *    before opening any of the directory's subdirs or after closing
 *    them, but not in the middle.
 *
 * 5. When the producer calls @c open_file or @c add_file, either:
 *
 *    (a) The producer must follow with any changes to the file
 *    (@c change_file_prop and/or @c apply_textdelta, as applicable),
 *    followed by a @c close_file call, before issuing any other file
 *    or directory calls, or
 *
 *    (b) The producer must follow with a @c change_file_prop call if
 *    it is applicable, before issuing any other file or directory
 *    calls; later, after all directory batons including the root
 *    have been closed, the producer must issue @c apply_textdelta
 *    and @c close_file calls.
 *
 * 6. When the producer calls @c apply_textdelta, it must make all of
 *    the window handler calls (including the @c NULL window at the
 *    end) before issuing any other #svn_delta_editor_t calls.
 *
 * So, the producer needs to use directory and file batons as if it
 * is doing a single depth-first traversal of the tree, with the
 * exception that the producer may keep file batons open in order to
 * make @c apply_textdelta calls at the end.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Pool Usage</h3>
 *
 * Many editor functions are invoked multiple times, in a sequence
 * determined by the editor "driver". The driver is responsible for
 * creating a pool for use on each iteration of the editor function,
 * and clearing that pool between each iteration. The driver passes
 * the appropriate pool on each function invocation.
 *
 * Based on the requirement of calling the editor functions in a
 * depth-first style, it is usually customary for the driver to similarly
 * nest the pools. However, this is only a safety feature to ensure
 * that pools associated with deeper items are always cleared when the
 * top-level items are also cleared. The interface does not assume, nor
 * require, any particular organization of the pools passed to these
 * functions. In fact, if "postfix deltas" are used for files, the file
 * pools definitely need to live outside the scope of their parent
 * directories' pools.
 *
 * Note that close_directory can be called *before* a file in that
 * directory has been closed. That is, the directory's baton is
 * closed before the file's baton. The implication is that
 * @c apply_textdelta and @c close_file should not refer to a parent
 * directory baton UNLESS the editor has taken precautions to
 * allocate it in a pool of the appropriate lifetime (the @a dir_pool
 * passed to @c open_directory and @c add_directory definitely does not
 * have the proper lifetime). In general, it is recommended to simply
 * avoid keeping a parent directory baton in a file baton.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Errors</h3>
 *
 * At least one implementation of the editor interface is
 * asynchronous; an error from one operation may be detected some
 * number of operations later.  As a result, an editor driver must not
 * assume that an error from an editing function resulted from the
 * particular operation being detected.  Moreover, once an editing
 * function returns an error, the edit is dead; the only further
 * operation which may be called on the editor is abort_edit.

/** Set @a *editor and @a *edit_baton to an depth-based filtering

 * requested_depth, taking into account whether not the edit drive is
 * making use of a target (via @a has_target), and forward editor
 * calls which operate "within" the request depth range through to @a
 * wrapped_editor.
 *
 * @a requested_depth must be one of the following depth values:
 * #svn_depth_infinity, #svn_depth_empty, #svn_depth_files,
 * #svn_depth_immediates, or #svn_depth_unknown.
 *
 * If filtering is deemed unnecessary (or if @a requested_depth is
 * #svn_depth_unknown), @a *editor and @a *edit_baton will be set to @a
 * wrapped_editor and @a wrapped_baton, respectively; otherwise,
 * they'll be set to new objects allocated from @a pool.
 *
 * @note Because the svn_delta_editor_t interface's @c delete_entry()
 * function doesn't carry node kind information, a depth-based
 * filtering editor being asked to filter for #svn_depth_files but
 * receiving a @c delete_entry() call on an immediate child of the
 * editor's target is unable to know if that deletion should be
 * allowed or filtered out -- a delete of a top-level file is okay in
 * this case, a delete of a top-level subdirectory is not.  As such,
 * this filtering editor takes a conservative approach, and ignores
 * top-level deletion requests when filtering for #svn_depth_files.
 * Fortunately, most non-depth-aware (pre-1.5) Subversion editor
 * drivers can be told to drive non-recursively (where non-recursive
 * means essentially #svn_depth_files), which means they won't
 * transmit out-of-scope editor commands anyway.
