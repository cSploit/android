 * @file svn_path.h
 * @brief A path manipulation library
 *
 * All incoming and outgoing paths are non-NULL and in UTF-8, unless
 * otherwise documented.
 *
 * No result path ever ends with a separator, no matter whether the
 * path is a file or directory, because we always canonicalize() it.
 *
 * Nearly all the @c svn_path_xxx functions expect paths passed into
 * them to be in canonical form as defined by the Subversion path
 * library itself.  The only functions which do *not* have such
 * expectations are:
 *
 *    - @c svn_path_canonicalize()
 *    - @c svn_path_is_canonical()
 *    - @c svn_path_internal_style()
 *    - @c svn_path_uri_encode()
 *
 * For the most part, we mean what most anyone would mean when talking
 * about canonical paths, but to be on the safe side, you must run
 * your paths through @c svn_path_canonicalize() before passing them to
 * other functions in this API.

 *
 * How does this differ in functionality from svn_path_condense_targets()?
 *
 * Here's the short version:
 *
 * 1.  Disclaimer: if you wish to debate the following, talk to Karl. :-)
 *     Order matters for updates because a multi-arg update is not
 *     atomic, and CVS users are used to, when doing 'cvs up targetA
 *     targetB' seeing targetA get updated, then targetB.  I think the
 *     idea is that if you're in a time-sensitive or flaky-network
 *     situation, a user can say, "I really *need* to update
 *     wc/A/D/G/tau, but I might as well update my whole working copy if
 *     I can."  So that user will do 'svn up wc/A/D/G/tau wc', and if
 *     something dies in the middles of the 'wc' update, at least the
 *     user has 'tau' up-to-date.
 *
 * 2.  Also, we have this notion of an anchor and a target for updates
 *     (the anchor is where the update editor is rooted, the target is
 *     the actual thing we want to update).  I needed a function that
 *     would NOT screw with my input paths so that I could tell the
 *     difference between someone being in A/D and saying 'svn up G' and
 *     being in A/D/G and saying 'svn up .' -- believe it or not, these
 *     two things don't mean the same thing.  svn_path_condense_targets()
 *     plays with absolute paths (which is fine, so does
 *     svn_path_remove_redundancies()), but the difference is that it
 *     actually tweaks those targets to be relative to the "grandfather
 *     path" common to all the targets.  Updates don't require a
 *     "grandfather path" at all, and even if it did, the whole
 *     conversion to an absolute path drops the crucial difference
 *     between saying "i'm in foo, update bar" and "i'm in foo/bar,
 *     update '.'"
