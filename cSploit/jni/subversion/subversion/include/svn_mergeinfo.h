/** Overview of the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property.
 *
 * Merge history is stored in the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property of files
 * and directories.  The @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property on a path stores the
 * complete list of changes merged to that path, either directly or via the
 * path's parent, grand-parent, etc..  A path may have empty mergeinfo which
 * means that nothing has been merged to that path or all previous merges
 * to the path were reversed.  Note that a path may have no mergeinfo, this
 * is not the same as empty mergeinfo.
 *
 * Every path in a tree may have @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set, but if the
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO for a path is equivalent to the
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO for its parent, then the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO on
 * the path will 'elide' (be removed) from the path as a post step to any
 * merge.  If a path's parent does not have any @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set,
 * the path's mergeinfo can elide to its nearest grand-parent,
 * great-grand-parent, etc. that has equivalent @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set
 * on it.
 *
 * If a path has no @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO of its own, it inherits mergeinfo
 * from its nearest parent that has @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set.  The
 * exception to this is @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO with non-inheritable revision
 * ranges.  These non-inheritable ranges apply only to the path which they
 * are set on.
 *
 * Due to Subversion's allowance for mixed revision working copies, both
 * elision and inheritance within the working copy presume the path
 * between a path and its nearest parent with mergeinfo is at the same
 * working revision.  If this is not the case then neither inheritance nor
 * elision can occur.
 *
 * The value of the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property is either an empty string
 * (representing empty mergeinfo) or a non-empty string consisting of
 * a path, a colon, and comma separated revision list, containing one or more
 * revision or revision ranges. Revision range start and end points are
 * separated by "-".  Revisions and revision ranges may have the optional
 * @c SVN_MERGEINFO_NONINHERITABLE_STR suffix to signify a non-inheritable
 * revision/revision range.
 *
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO Value Grammar:
 *
 *   Token             Definition
 *   -----             ----------
 *   revisionrange     REVISION1 "-" REVISION2
 *   revisioneelement  (revisionrange | REVISION)"*"?
 *   rangelist         revisioneelement (COMMA revisioneelement)*
 *   revisionline      PATHNAME COLON rangelist
 *   top               "" | (revisionline (NEWLINE revisionline))*
 *
 * The PATHNAME is the source of a merge and the rangelist the revision(s)
 * merged to the path @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO is set on directly or indirectly
 * via inheritance.  PATHNAME must always exist at the specified rangelist
 * and thus a single merge may result in multiple revisionlines if the source
 * was renamed.
 *
 * Rangelists must be sorted from lowest to highest revision and cannot
 * contain overlapping revisionlistelements.  REVISION1 must be less than
 * REVISION2.  Consecutive single revisions that can be represented by a
 * revisionrange are allowed however (e.g. '5,6,7,8,9-12' or '5-12' are
 * both acceptable).

/** Terminology for data structures that contain mergeinfo.
 *
 * Subversion commonly uses several data structures to represent
 * mergeinfo in RAM:
 *
 * (a) Strings (@c svn_string_t *) containing "unparsed mergeinfo".
 *
 * (b) A "rangelist".  An array (@c apr_array_header_t *) of non-overlapping
 *     merge ranges (@c svn_merge_range_t *), sorted as said by
 *     @c svn_sort_compare_ranges().  An empty range list is represented by
 *     an empty array.  Unless specifically noted otherwise, all APIs require
 *     rangelists that describe only forward ranges, i.e. the range's start
 *     revision is less than its end revision.
 *
 * (c) @c svn_mergeinfo_t, called "mergeinfo".  A hash mapping merge
 *     source paths (@c const char *, starting with slashes) to
 *     non-empty rangelist arrays.  A @c NULL hash is used to represent
 *     no mergeinfo and an empty hash is used to represent empty
 *     mergeinfo.
 *
 * (d) @c svn_mergeinfo_catalog_t, called a "mergeinfo catalog".  A hash
 *     mapping paths (@c const char *) to @c svn_mergeinfo_t.
 *
 * Both @c svn_mergeinfo_t and @c svn_mergeinfo_catalog_t are just
 * typedefs for @c apr_hash_t *; there is no static type-checking, and
 * you still use standard @c apr_hash_t functions to interact with
 * them.
 *
 * Note that while the keys of mergeinfos are always absolute from the
 * repository root, the keys of a catalog may be relative to something
 * else, such as an RA session root.
