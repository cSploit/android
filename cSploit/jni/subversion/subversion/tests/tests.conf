### This config file configures some aspects of the Subversion test
### suite.  Pass --config-file FILENAME to test programs if running
### them manually; "make check" passes this file in automatically.

### Currently, it is used for two purposes: it is used to configure
### memcached for direct svn_cache/memcached tests in
### libsvn_subr/cache-test; and it is copied into new FSFS
### repositories as fsfs.conf (to configure their use of memcached as
### well).

[memcached-servers]
### Run memcached servers and enter lines like the following (the key
### is ignored):
# key = 127.0.0.1:11211

[caches]
### In the test suite, we should make FSFS cache failures into actual
### test failures:
fail-stop = true
