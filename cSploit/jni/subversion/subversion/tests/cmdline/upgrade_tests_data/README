OVERVIEW

This directory contains working copies (and other data) used to
test Subversion's working copy ugrade process. The files are
typically stored as a .tar.bz2 in order to hide their "funny"
format data from Subversion's normal administrative processes.


=============================================================================

FORMAT_*

The format_*.tar.bz2 data files each represent a checkout of
^/trunk/notes/wc-ng at approximately revision 917840. These
checkouts were performed using specific revisions of Subversion
in order to produce a .svn administrative area with the required
format.

SVN_WC__VERSION   Subversion revision used
---------------   ------------------------
12 (a)            877576
12 (b)            879401
13                879813
14                880116
15                886350
16                917838

There are two "format 12" working copies:
  (a) the wcprop values are stored in .svn/all-wcprops
  (b) the wcprop values are stored in BASE_NODE.dav_cache

You'll note that ($revision + 1) is the revision where the
format was bumped, or the wcprops were moved into the
database. Therefore, these working copies represent the last
revision of Subversion to use the specific format value.
