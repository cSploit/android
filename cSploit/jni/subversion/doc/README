A rough guide:

                             "Version Control with Subversion"
                             (a.k.a. "The Subversion Book", "The Svnbook",
                             and formerly entitled
                             "Subversion: The Definitive Guide".)
                             This is the book that has been published by
                             O'Reilly & Associates. For both newbies and
                             experts alike.  Written in DocBook Lite,
                             and now maintained in a separate repository
                             of its own.
