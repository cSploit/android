Version 0.35.1 [Beta] (branching 19 December 2003, from /tags/0.35.0)
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/0.35.1

                              NOTICES:

       This release is to correct for the problems in the 0.35.0
       release and affects Windows users only:

       * fix: file handle leak (r8048)
       * fix: UTF-8 path problem (issue #1660)


Version 0.35.0 (branching 12 December 2003, from revision 7994)
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/branches/0.35.0

                              NOTICES:

    1. As of this release, Subversion once again does deltification
       automatically.  This means that the deltification step most
       repositories introduced into their post-commit hooks as of
       release 0.33.0 should now be reverted.  Look for a line with
       "svnadmin deltify" in hooks/post-commit, and remove it.

    2. We now recommend using Berkeley DB 4.2.52 or higher for SVN
       repositories.  See http://sleepycat.com/download/index.shtml.

 User-visible changes:
 * BDB log files are automatically pruned, with BDB 4.2.50 and higher (#1615)
 * deltification is automatic again (issue #1601)
 * fix: svn diff -rX:Y wcpath' may lie (issue #1616)
 * fix: URI-decoding problem on 'svn import' (issue #1622)
 * many other enhancements, minor features, and bugfixes not listed here


 Developer-visible changes:
 * misc. improvements on Perl and Java bindings
 * improved diff handling (r7985)
 * many other changes not listed here

    1. This client may be incompatible with ra_dav servers <= 0.31.

    2. In order to make commits more responsive, repository
       deltification is no longer automatic.  However, you may want
       to run deltification as a background process in your repository

 * cvs2svn.py bugfixes, especially issue #1440
 * book and documentation updates
 * removed server config options ssl-ignore-invalid-date and
   ssl-override-cert-hostname (r7644)

Version 0.28.2 (released 29 Aug 2003, revision 6946)
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/0.28.2

 User-visible changes:
 * MAJOR BUGFIX:  revert revision 6764.

      The new history-searching code was over-stressing our use
      of BerkeleyDB transactions, causing checkouts to go

      This is a temporary fix for a larger design problem.  See issue
      http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1499


Version 0.28.1

  It is strictly an updated release, build with the correct version
  of autoconf; autconf-2.57
