This directory contains test related to regression tracking that require
a specific setup and a complete test.  Each regression test must be 
contained in a test directory whose name is "its<number>", where <number>
is the ITS number, and it must be entirely executed by a script, contained
in that directory and with the same name of the directory.  It can exploit
all the helpers provided for common tests (variables in scripts/defines.sh,
data files in data/, ...), but it should simultaneously be as self contained
and as general as possible.  Warning: occasionally, data files and
shell variables may change, so limit their use to real needs.

For example, if an issue only appears with a certain database type, the
test itself should only run when invoked for that database type; 
otherwise, if the issue appears whatever backend is used, the test should
be parametric, so that it is run with the backend selected at run-time
via the "-b" switch of the "run" script.

Regression tests are prepared on a voluntary basis, so don't expect all 
bugs to have a test any soon.  When the issue reporter provides a simple,
yet complete means to reproduce the bug she's reporting, this may speed up 
the process.  In case, only put neutral data in bug exploitation reports.
