- de-IBM SLAPI
- add a config statement, or redefine the dynamic backend one,
  "modulepath", to set/modify the load path also for plugins
  (both plugins and modules use ltdl, so "modulepath" suffices ...)
- improve slapi logging (use some [v]s[n]printf function)
- add a config statement to set the log file name, or better
- use syslog where available?
- add some plugin monitoring stuff in back-monitor (e.g. a subentry
  for each plugin with data from struct Slapi_PluginDesc)
- This is a very tough task: try to implement a sandbox to execute
  plugins in, trap deadly signals and possibly disable unsafe plugins
  without crashing slapd (fork from inside thread? trap signals
  and longjump to next plugin execution? Brrr).
