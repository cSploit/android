Differences from 2.0 Perl API:

- Perl 5.6 is supported

- backend methods return actual LDAP result codes, not
  true/false; this gives the Perl module finer control
  of the error returned to the client

- a filterSearchResults configuration file directive was
  added to tell the backend glue that the results returned
  from the Perl module are candidates only

- the "init" method is called after the backend has been
  initialized - this lets you do some initialization after
  *all* configuration file directives have been read

- the interface for the search method is improved to
  pass the scope, deferencing policy, size limit, etc.
  See SampleLDAP.pm for details.
