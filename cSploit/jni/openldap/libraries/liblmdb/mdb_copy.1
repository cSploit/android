.SH NAME
mdb_copy \- LMDB environment copy tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mdb_copy
[\c
.BR \-n ]
.B srcpath
[\c
.BR dstpath ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mdb_copy
utility copies an LMDB environment. The environment can
be copied regardless of whether it is currently in use.
No lockfile is created, since it gets recreated at need.

If
.I dstpath
is specified it must be the path of an empty directory
for storing the backup. Otherwise, the backup will be
written to stdout.

.SH OPTIONS
.BR \-n
Open LDMB environment(s) which do not use subdirectories.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is zero if no errors occur.
Errors result in a non-zero exit status and
a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
.SH CAVEATS
This utility can trigger significant file size growth if run
in parallel with write transactions, because pages which they
free during copying cannot be reused until the copy is done.
