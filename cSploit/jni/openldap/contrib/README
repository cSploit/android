OpenLDAP Contributed Software README

OpenLDAP Project provides a number of freely-distributable LDAP
software packages.  While distributed as part of OpenLDAP Software,
they are not necessarily supported by the OpenLDAP Project.  Some
packages may be out of date.  Each package in this directory has its
own use and may have different redistribution restrictions than typical
for OpenLDAP Software.
