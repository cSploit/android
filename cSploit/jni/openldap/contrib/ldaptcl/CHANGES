Package rersion 2.0:
- Detects OpenLDAP 2.0 and builds correctly with it.
- Increment major version to 2, library file to libldaptcl2.0.so.
- Can now perform add/delete/replace modifications in a single command.
- Replaced calls to TclX_WrongArgs with core Tcl_WrongNumArgs to reduce
  dependency on Extended Tcl.
- Wrap dereference search control with #ifdef LDAP_OPT_DEREF.
- Deref during search should work.
- Add protocol_version option to ldap init command.
- Add LDAPTCL_PROTOCOL_VERSION_DEFAULT to allow specifying the default
  protocol version used.
- Add controlArray(timeout) to control timeouts during searches.
- Add controlArray(cache) to control caching current search results.
  (Experience has shown this to be not very useful or not working correctly.
  Caching search results should probably be done in Ldaptcl rather than
  letting the LDAP API do it.)
- Add "compare" subcommand
- Add experimental trap subcommand (undocumented -- use at your own risk).

Package version 1.2:

- Filter no longer a required controlArray member, defaults to objectclass=*.
- Sets errorCode with LDAP macro string value (better to test than the more
  human readable values).
- Shorten minimum required characters for search scope definitions: now allows
  "base", "one", and "sub".  For the latter two, additional characters are
  ignored.
- Now compiles successfully with -devel branch.
- Client cache management code enabled for OpenLDAP versions <= 1.2.4.  (This
  code is relatively untested and feedback is welcome.)
