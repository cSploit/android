These files were pulled from the nss-pam-ldapd project version 0.8.12.
Copyright notices are in the individual files.

This is not the full distribution of nss-pam-ldapd, and does not
include the client-side stub libraries.  Get the latest release of
nss-pam-ldapd from http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/ to use
this overlay.

If your system already has the nss-pam-ldapd stub libraries
installed, make sure the versions match the version number
shown above. Otherwise, there may be incompatible differences in
the protocols being used. Currently nssov requires at least
version 0.8.11. If your system's version is older, you will need
to install the client-side stubs from source.
