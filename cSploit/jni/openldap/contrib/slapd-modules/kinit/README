This directory contains the "kinit" slapd module. It is a simple plugin to
have slapd request a Kerberos TGT and keep it renewed as long as slapd is
running.

The current implementation has only been tested against the MIT variant of
the Kerberos libraries. (Heimdal support might come later)

To use the overlay just load it into the slapd process:

    moduleload </path/to>/kinit.so <principal> </path/to/key.tab>

The module accepts two arguments. The first one being the principal for which
to request the TGT (it defaults to "ldap/<your hostname>@<DEFAULTREALM>")
and the second one is the path to the keytab file to use for
authentication, defaulting to whatever your system wide kerberos settings
default to).

Use Makefile or the following commands should work to
build it from inside the unpacked slapd sources, provided the required KRB5
header files and libaries are installed on your system:

    gcc -fPIC -c -I ../../../include/ -I ../../../servers/slapd kinit.c
    gcc -shared -o kinit.so kinit.o -lkrb5
