autogroup overlay Readme

DESCRIPTION
    The autogroup overlay allows automated updates of group memberships which
    meet the requirements of any filter contained in the group definition.
    The filters are built from LDAP URI-valued attributes. Any time an object
    is added/deleted/updated, it is tested for compliance with the filters,
    and its membership is accordingly updated. For searches and compares
    it behaves like a static group.
    If the attribute part of the URI is filled, the group entry is populated
    by the values of this attribute in the entries resulting from the search.

BUILDING
    A Makefile is included.

CONFIGURATION
    # dyngroup.schema:
        The dyngroup schema must be modified, adding the 'member' attribute
        to the MAY clause of the groupOfURLs object class, i.e.:

        objectClass ( NetscapeLDAPobjectClass:33
        NAME 'groupOfURLs'
        SUP top STRUCTURAL
        MUST cn
        MAY ( memberURL $ businessCategory $ description $ o $ ou $
                owner $ seeAlso $ member) )


    # slapd.conf:

    moduleload /path/to/autogroup.so
        Loads the overlay (OpenLDAP must be built with --enable-modules).

    overlay autogroup
        This directive adds the autogroup overlay to the current database.

    autogroup-attrset <group-oc> <URL-ad> <member-ad>
        This configuration option is defined for the autogroup overlay.
        It may have multiple occurrences, and it must appear after the
        overlay directive.

        The value <group-oc> is the name of the objectClass that represents 
        the group.

        The value <URL-ad> is the name of the attributeDescription that 
        contains the URI that is converted to the filters. If no URI is 
        present, there will be no members in that group. It must be a subtype
        of labeledURI.

        The value <member-ad> is the name of the attributeDescription that
        specifies the member attribute. User modification of this attribute 
        is disabled for consistency.

    autogroup-memberof-ad <memberof-ad>
        This configuration option is defined for the autogroup overlay.

        It defines the attribute that is used by the memberOf overlay
        to store the names of groups that an entry is member of; it must be
        DN-valued. It should be set to the same value as
        memberof-memberof-ad. It defaults to 'memberOf'.


EXAMPLE
    ### slapd.conf
    include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
    # ...
    moduleload /path/to/autogroup.so
    # ...

    database <database>
    # ...

    overlay autogroup
    autogroup-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member
    ### end slapd.conf

    ### slapd.conf
    include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
    # ...
    moduleload /path/to/autogroup.so
    moduleload /path/to/memberof.so
    # ...

    database <database>
    #...

    overlay memberof
    memberof-memberof-ad foo

    overlay autogroup
    autogroup-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member
    autogroup-memberof-ad foo
    ### end slapd.conf

CAVEATS
    As with static groups, update operations on groups with a large number
    of members may be slow.
    If the attribute part of the URI is specified, modify and delete operations
    are more difficult to handle. In these cases the overlay will try to detect
    if groups have been modified and then simply refresh them. This can cause
    performance hits if the search specified by the URI deals with a significant
    number of entries.
