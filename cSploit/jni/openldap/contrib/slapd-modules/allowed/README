This directory contains a slapd overlay, "allowed".

    --- o --- o --- o ---

It adds to entries returned by search operations the value of attributes

"allowedAttributes"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675217(VS.85).aspx>

"allowedAttributesEffective"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675218(VS.85).aspx>

"allowedChildClasses"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675219(VS.85).aspx>

"allowedChildClassesEffective"
	<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675220(VS.85).aspx>

No other use is made of those attributes: they cannot be compared,
they cannot be used in search filters, they cannot be used in ACLs, ...

    --- o --- o --- o ---

Usage: add to slapd.conf(5)


moduleload	path/to/allowed.so
overlay		allowed

or add

dn: olcOverlay={0}allowed,olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config
objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
olcOverlay: {0}allowed

as a child of the database that's intended to support this feature
(replace "olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config" with the appropriate parent);
or use

dn: olcOverlay={0}allowed,olcDatabase={-1}frontend,cn=config
objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
olcOverlay: {0}allowed

if it's supposed to be global.
