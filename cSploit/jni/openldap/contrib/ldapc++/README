This is an unstable development release of a LDAPv3 C++ Class Library.
It was created as the diploma thesis (final project) of my computer 
science studies.
It is based upon the OpenLDAP C-API and so it needs the C-library and
Headerfiles installed.

Installation:
=============
Just run the "configure" script with the apropriate options. Especially
these two options can be imported, if you didn't install the OpenLDAP-
libraries in the default place:

--with-libldap=<path to libldap> : To tell configure where the OpenLDAP
        C-libraries are located.
--with-ldap-includes=<path to ldap include files> : To tell configure
        where the OpenLDAP include files are located.
--enable-debug to enable compliation with debugging symbols and stderr
        output
(run "configure --help" to see all possible command line options)

If configure finishes without problems. You can simply call "make" to 
build the library and "make install" to install it.

Documentation:
==============
Docs are very incomplete. You can either look in the source files for 
the documentation comment of generate documentation  using "doxygen"
or any other javadoc compatible documentation generator.

Bugreports and other feedback:
==============================
If you find bugs please feel free to send me a detailed report. All 
other kinds of feedback are welcomed as well.
