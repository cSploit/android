Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are working documents of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, its working groups, and
individual contributors.

I-Ds are only valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated,
replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It is
inappropriate to use I-Ds as reference material or to cite them
other than as "work in progress."

The OpenLDAP Project maintains copies of I-D for which we find
interesting.  Existance here does not necessarily imply any support
nor any plans to support for the I-D.  The I-Ds found in this
directory may be stale, expired, or otherwise out of date.

Please go to <http://www.ietf.org/> for latest revisions (and
status).
