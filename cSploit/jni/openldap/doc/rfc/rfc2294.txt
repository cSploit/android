Abstract

   This document defines a representation of the O/R Address hierarchy
   in the Directory Information Tree [6, 1].  This is useful for a range
   of purposes, including:

    o  Support for MHS Routing [4].

    o  Support for X.400/RFC 822 address mappings [2, 5].

   Please send comments to the author or to the discussion group <mhs-
   ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com>.

1  The O/R Address Hierarchy

   An O/R Address hierarchy is represented in the X.500 directory by
   associating directory name components with O/R Address components.
   An example of this is given in Figure 1.  The object classes and
   attributes required to support this representation are defined in
   Figure 2.  The schema, which defines the hierarchy in which these
   objects are represented in the directory information tree is
   specified in Table 1.  A given object class defined in the table will
   always be higher in the DIT than an object class defined lower down
   the table.  Valid combinations of O/R Address components are defined
   in X.400.

                    Figure 2:  O/R Address Hierarchy

   The hierarchy is defined so that:

   1.  The representation is defined so that it is straightforward to
       make a mechanical transformation in either direction.  This
       requires that each node is named by an attribute whose type can
       determine the mapping.

   2.  Where there are multiple domain defined attributes, the first
       in the sequence is the most significant.

   3.  Physical Delivery (postal) addresses are not represented in
       this hierarchy.  This is primarily because physical delivery can
       be handled by the Access Unit routing mechanisms defined in [4],
       and there is no need for this representation.

   4.  Terminal and network forms of address are not handled, except
       for X.121 form, which is useful for addressing faxes.

   5.  MHSCountry is defined as a subclass of Country, and so the
       same entry will be used for MHS Routing as for the rest of the
       DIT.

   6.  The numeric country code will be an alias.

   7.  ADMD will always be present in the hierarchy.  This is true
       in the case of " " and of "0".  This facilitates an easy
       mechanical transformation between the two forms of address.

   8.  Each node is named by the relevant part of the O/R Address.

   9.  Aliases may be used in other parts of the tree, in order to
       normalize alternate values.  Where an alias is used, the value of
       the alias should be present as an alternate value in the node
       aliased to.  Aliases may not be used for domain defined
       attributes.

RFC 2294               Directory Information Tree             March 1998


   10. Domain Defined Attributes are named by a multi-valued RDN
       (Relative Distinguished Name), consisting of the type and value.
       This is done so that standard attribute syntaxes can be used.

   11. Where an O/R Address has a valid Printable String and T.61 form,
       both must be present, with one as an alias for the other.  This
       is so that direct lookup of the name will work, independent of
       the variant used.  When both are present in an O/R Address being
       looked up, either may be used to construct the distinguished
       name.

   12. Personal name is handled by use of the mHSPerson object class.
       Each of the components of the personal name will be present in
       the relative distinguished name, which will usually be multi-
       valued.

   The relationship between X.400 O/R Addresses and the X.400 Entries
   (Attribute Type and Object Class) are given in Table 2.  Where there
   are multiple Organizational Units or Domain Defined Attributes, each
   component is mapped onto a single X.500 entry.

   Note: When an X.121 address is used for addressing fax transmission,
       this may only be done relative to the PRMD or ADMD. This is in
       line with the current X.400 standards position.  This means that
       it is not possible to use this form of addressing for an
       organizational or departmental fax gateway service.

2  Notation

   O/R Addresses are written in the standard X.400 Notation.
   Distinguished Names use the string representation of distinguished
   names defined in [3].  The keywords used for the attributes defined
   in this specification are given in Table 3.

3  Example Representation

   The O/R Address:

   I=S; S=Kille; OU1=CS; O=UCL,
   P=UK.AC; A=Gold 400; C=GB;


   would be represented in the directory as:

   MHS-I=S + MHS-S=Kille, MHS-OU=CS, MHS-O=UCL,

4  Mapping from O/R Address to Directory Name

   The primary application of this mapping is to take an X.400 encoded
   O/R Address and to generate an equivalent directory name.  This
   mapping is only used for selected types of O/R Address:



Kille                       Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 2294               Directory Information Tree             March 1998


    o  Mnemonic form

    o  Numeric form

    o  Terminal form, where country is present and X121 addressing
       is used

   Other forms of O/R address are handled by Access Unit mechanisms.
   The O/R Address is treated as an ordered list, with the order as
   defined in Table 1.  For each O/R Address attribute, generate the
   equivalent directory naming attribute.  In most cases, the mapping is
   mechanical.  Printable String or Teletex encodings are chosen as
   appropriate.  Where both forms are present in the O/R Address, either
   form may be used to generate the distinguished name.  Both will be
   represented in the DIT. There are two special cases:

   1.  A DDA generates a multi-valued RDN

   2.  The Personal Name is mapped to a multi-valued RDN

   In many cases, an O/R Address will be provided, and only the higher
   components of the address will be represented in the DIT. In this
   case, the "longest possible match" should be returned.

5  Mapping from Directory Name to O/R Address

   The reverse mapping is also needed in some cases.  All of the naming
   attributes are unique, so the mapping is mechanically reversible.
