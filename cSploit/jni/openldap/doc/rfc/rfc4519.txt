Abstract

   This document is an integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) technical specification.  It provides a technical
   specification of attribute types and object classes intended for use
   by LDAP directory clients for many directory services, such as White
   Pages.  These objects are widely used as a basis for the schema in
   many LDAP directories.  This document does not cover attributes used
   for the administration of directory servers, nor does it include
   directory objects defined for specific uses in other documents.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides an overview of attribute types and object
   classes intended for use by Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) directory clients for many directory services, such as White
   Pages.  Originally specified in the X.500 [X.500] documents, these
   objects are widely used as a basis for the schema in many LDAP
   directories.  This document does not cover attributes used for the
   administration of directory servers, nor does it include directory
   objects defined for specific uses in other documents.

1.1.  Relationship with Other Specifications

   This document is an integral part of the LDAP technical specification
   [RFC4510], which obsoletes the previously defined LDAP technical
   specification, RFC 3377, in its entirety.  In terms of RFC 2256,
   Sections 6 and 8 of RFC 2256 are obsoleted by [RFC4517].  Sections
   5.1, 5.2, 7.1, and 7.2 of RFC 2256 are obsoleted by [RFC4512].  The
   remainder of RFC 2256 is obsoleted by this document.  The technical
   specification for the 'dc' attribute type and 'dcObject' object class
   found in RFC 2247 are superseded by sections 2.4 and 3.3 of this
   document.  The remainder of RFC 2247 remains in force.

RFC 4519           LDAP: Schema for User Applications          June 2006


   This document updates RFC 2798 by replacing the informative
   description of the 'uid' attribute type with the definitive
   description provided in Section 2.39 of this document.

   This document updates RFC 2377 by replacing the informative
   description of the 'uidObject' object class with the definitive
   description provided in Section 3.14 of this document.

   A number of schema elements that were included in the previous
   revision of the LDAP Technical Specification are not included in this
   revision of LDAP.  PKI-related schema elements are now specified in
   [RFC4523].  Unless reintroduced in future technical specifications,
   the remainder are to be considered Historic.

   The descriptions in this document SHALL be considered definitive for
   use in LDAP.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  General Issues

   This document references Syntaxes defined in Section 3 of [RFC4517]
   and Matching Rules defined in Section 4 of [RFC4517].

   The definitions of Attribute Types and Object Classes are written
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC4234] of
   AttributeTypeDescription and ObjectClassDescription given in
   [RFC4512].  Lines have been folded for readability.  When such values
   are transferred as attribute values in the LDAP Protocol, the values
   will not contain line breaks.

2.  Attribute Types

   The attribute types contained in this section hold user information.

   There is no requirement that servers implement the 'searchGuide' and
   'teletexTerminalIdentifier' attribute types.  In fact, their use is
   greatly discouraged.

   An LDAP server implementation SHOULD recognize the rest of the
   attribute types described in this section.

RFC 4519           LDAP: Schema for User Applications          June 2006


2.1.  'businessCategory'

   The 'businessCategory' attribute type describes the kinds of business
   performed by an organization.  Each kind is one value of this
   multi-valued attribute.
   (Source: X.520 [X.520])

      ( 2.5.4.15 NAME 'businessCategory'
         EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
         SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 refers to the Directory String syntax
   [RFC4517].

   Examples: "banking", "transportation", and "real estate".

2.2.  'c'

   The 'c' ('countryName' in X.500) attribute type contains a two-letter
   ISO 3166 [ISO3166] country code.
   (Source: X.520 [X.520])

      ( 2.5.4.6 NAME 'c'
         SUP name
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.11
         SINGLE-VALUE )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.11 refers to the Country String syntax
   [RFC4517].

   Examples: "DE", "AU" and "FR".

2.3.  'cn'

   The 'cn' ('commonName' in X.500) attribute type contains names of an
   object.  Each name is one value of this multi-valued attribute.  If
   the object corresponds to a person, it is typically the person's full
   name.
   (Source: X.520 [X.520])

      ( 2.5.4.3 NAME 'cn'
         SUP name )

   Examples: "Martin K Smith", "Marty Smith" and "printer12".

RFC 4519           LDAP: Schema for User Applications          June 2006


2.4.  'dc'

   The 'dc' ('domainComponent' in RFC 1274) attribute type is a string
   holding one component, a label, of a DNS domain name
   [RFC1034][RFC2181] naming a host [RFC1123].  That is, a value of this
   attribute is a string of ASCII characters adhering to the following
   ABNF [RFC4234]:

   label = (ALPHA / DIGIT) [*61(ALPHA / DIGIT / HYPHEN) (ALPHA / DIGIT)]
   ALPHA   = %x41-5A / %x61-7A     ; "A"-"Z" / "a"-"z"
   DIGIT   = %x30-39               ; "0"-"9"
   HYPHEN  = %x2D                  ; hyphen ("-")

   The encoding of IA5String for use in LDAP is simply the characters of
   the ASCII label.  The equality matching rule is case insensitive, as
   is today's DNS.  (Source: RFC 2247 [RFC2247] and RFC 1274 [RFC 1274])

      ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.25 NAME 'dc'
         EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
         SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
         SINGLE-VALUE )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 refers to the IA5 String syntax
   [RFC4517].

   Examples: Valid values include "example" and "com" but not
   "example.com".  The latter is invalid as it contains multiple domain
   components.

   It is noted that the directory service will not ensure that values of
   this attribute conform to the host label restrictions [RFC1123]
   illustrated by the <label> production provided above.  It is the
   directory client's responsibility to ensure that the labels it stores
   in this attribute are appropriately restricted.

   Directory applications supporting International Domain Names SHALL
   use the ToASCII method [RFC3490] to produce the domain component
   label.  The special considerations discussed in Section 4 of RFC 3490
   [RFC3490] should be taken, depending on whether the domain component
   is used for "stored" or "query" purposes.

2.5.  'description'

   The 'description' attribute type contains human-readable descriptive
   phrases about the object.  Each description is one value of this
   multi-valued attribute.
   (Source: X.520 [X.520])

         SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 refers to the Directory String syntax
   [RFC4517].

   Examples: "a color printer", "Maintenance is done every Monday, at
             1pm.", and "distribution list for all technical staff".

2.6.  'destinationIndicator'

   The 'destinationIndicator' attribute type contains country and city
   strings associated with the object (the addressee) needed to provide
   the Public Telegram Service.  The strings are composed in accordance
   with CCITT Recommendations F.1 [F.1] and F.31 [F.31].  Each string is
   one value of this multi-valued attribute.
   (Source: X.520 [X.520])

      ( 2.5.4.27 NAME 'destinationIndicator'
         EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
         SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44 )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44 refers to the Printable String syntax
   [RFC4517].

   Examples: "AASD" as a destination indicator for Sydney, Australia.
             "GBLD" as a destination indicator for London, United
             Kingdom.

   It is noted that the directory will not ensure that values of this
   attribute conform to the F.1 and F.31 CCITT Recommendations.  It is
   the application's responsibility to ensure destination indicators
   that it stores in this attribute are appropriately constructed.

2.7.  'distinguishedName'

   The 'distinguishedName' attribute type is not used as the name of the
   object itself, but it is instead a base type from which some user
   attribute types with a DN syntax can inherit.

   It is unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an
   entry.  LDAP server implementations that do not support attribute
   subtyping need not recognize this attribute in requests.  Client
   implementations MUST NOT assume that LDAP servers are capable of
   performing attribute subtyping.

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 refers to the DN syntax [RFC4517].

2.8.  'dnQualifier'

   The 'dnQualifier' attribute type contains disambiguating information
   strings to add to the relative distinguished name of an entry.  The
   information is intended for use when merging data from multiple
   sources in order to prevent conflicts between entries that would
   otherwise have the same name.  Each string is one value of this
   multi-valued attribute.  It is recommended that a value of the
   'dnQualifier' attribute be the same for all entries from a particular
   source.

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44 refers to the Printable String syntax
   [RFC4517].

   Examples: "20050322123345Z" - timestamps can be used to disambiguate
             information.
             "123456A" - serial numbers can be used to disambiguate
             information.

2.9.  'enhancedSearchGuide'

   The 'enhancedSearchGuide' attribute type contains sets of information
   for use by directory clients in constructing search filters.  Each
   set is one value of this multi-valued attribute.
   (Source: X.520 [X.520])

      ( 2.5.4.47 NAME 'enhancedSearchGuide'

2.18.  'name'

   The 'name' attribute type is the attribute supertype from which user
   attribute types with the name syntax inherit.  Such attribute types
   are typically used for naming.  The attribute type is multi-valued.

   It is unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an
   entry.  LDAP server implementations that do not support attribute
   subtyping need not recognize this attribute in requests.  Client
   implementations MUST NOT assume that LDAP servers are capable of
   performing attribute subtyping.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has updated the LDAP

      Descriptor (short name): see comments
      Object Identifier: see comments
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
         Andrew Sciberras <andrew.sciberras@eb2bcom.com>
      Usage: (A = attribute type, O = Object Class) see comment
      Specification: RFC 4519
      Author/Change Controller: IESG

   Comments

      In the LDAP descriptors registry, the following descriptors (short
      names) have been updated to refer to RFC 4519.  Names that need to
      be reserved, rather than assigned to an Object Identifier, will
      contain an Object Identifier value of RESERVED.

5.  Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations, or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and
   integrity, since this may result in disclosure of the password to
   unauthorized parties.

   Multiple attribute values for the 'userPassword' attribute need to be
   used with care.  Especially reset/deletion of a password by an
   administrator without knowing the old user password gets tricky or
   impossible if multiple values for different applications are present.

   Certainly, applications that intend to replace the 'userPassword'
   value(s) with new value(s) should use modify/replaceValues (or
   modify/deleteAttribute+addAttribute).  In addition, server
   implementations are encouraged to provide administrative controls
   that, if enabled, restrict the 'userPassword' attribute to one value.

   Note that when used for authentication purposes [RFC4513], the user
   need only prove knowledge of one of the values, not all of the
   values.

   The 'dc' attribute type definition and the 'dcObject' object class
   definition in this document supersede the specification in RFC 2247
   by S. Kille, M. Wahl, A. Grimstad, R. Huber, and S. Sataluri.

   The 'uid' attribute type definition in this document supersedes the
   specification of the 'userid' in RFC 1274 by P. Barker and S. Kille
   and of the uid in RFC 2798 by M. Smith.

   The 'uidObject' object class definition in this document supersedes
   the specification of the 'uidObject' in RFC 2377 by A. Grimstad, R.
   Huber, S. Sataluri, and M. Wahl.

Appendix A.  Changes Made Since RFC 2256

   This appendix lists the changes that have been made from RFC 2256 to
   RFC 4519.

   This appendix is not a normative part of this specification, which
   has been provided for informational purposes only.

      1.  Replaced the document title.

      2.  Removed the IESG Note.

      3.  Dependencies on RFC 1274 have been eliminated.

      4.  Added a Security Considerations section and an IANA
          Considerations section.

      5.  Deleted the conformance requirement for subschema object
          classes in favor of a statement in [RFC4517].

      6.  Added explanation to attribute types and to each object class.

      7.  Removed Section 4, Syntaxes, and Section 6, Matching Rules,
          (moved to [RFC4517]).

      8.  Removed the certificate-related attribute types:
          authorityRevocationList, cACertificate,
          certificateRevocationList, crossCertificatePair,
          deltaRevocationList, supportedAlgorithms, and userCertificate.

          Removed the certificate-related Object Classes:
          certificationAuthority, certificationAuthority-V2,
          cRLDistributionPoint, strongAuthenticationUser, and
          userSecurityInformation

          LDAP PKI is now discussed in [RFC4523].

      9.  Removed the dmdName, knowledgeInformation,
          presentationAddress, protocolInformation, and
          supportedApplicationContext attribute types and the dmd,
          applicationEntity, and dSA object classes.

      10. Deleted the aliasedObjectName and objectClass attribute type
          definitions.  Deleted the alias and top object class
          definitions.  They are included in [RFC4512].

RFC 4519           LDAP: Schema for User Applications          June 2006


      11. Added the 'dc' attribute type from RFC 2247, making the
          distinction between 'stored' and 'query' values when preparing
          IDN strings.

      12. Numerous editorial changes.

      13. Removed upper bound after the SYNTAX oid in all attribute
          definitions where it appeared.

      14. Added text about Unicode, SASLprep [RFC4013], and UTF-8 for
          userPassword.

      15. Included definitions, comments and references for 'dcObject'
          and 'uidObject'.

      16. Replaced PKI schema references to use RFC 4523.

      17. Spelt out and referenced ABNF on first usage.

      18. Removed Section 2.4 (Source).  Replaced the source table with
          explicit references for each definition.

      19. All references to an attribute type or object class are
          enclosed in single quotes.

      20. The layout of attribute type definitions has been changed to
          provide consistency throughout the document:
          > Section Heading
          > Description of Attribute type
          > Multivalued description
          > Source Information
          > Definition
          > Example
          > Additional Comments

          Adding this consistent output included the addition of
          examples to some definitions.

      21. References to alternate names for attributes types are
          provided with a reference to where they were originally
          specified.

      22. Clarification of the description of 'distinguishedName' and
          'name', in regards to these attribute types being supertypes.

      23. Spelt out ISDN on first usage.
