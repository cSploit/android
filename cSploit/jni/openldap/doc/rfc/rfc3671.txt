Abstract

   X.500 collective attributes allow common characteristics to be shared
   between collections of entries.  This document summarizes the X.500
   information model for collective attributes and describes use of
   collective attributes in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol).  This document provides schema definitions for collective
   attributes for use in LDAP.

1.  Introduction

   In X.500 [X.500], a collective attribute is "a user attribute whose
   values are the same for each member of an entry collection" [X.501].
   This document details their use in the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377].

1.1.  Entry Collections

   A collection of entries is a grouping of object and alias entries
   based upon common properties or shared relationship between the
   corresponding entries which share certain attributes.  An entry
   collection consists of all entries within scope of a collective
   attributes subentry [RFC3672].  An entry can belong to several entry
   collections.

RFC 3671             Collective Attributes in LDAP         December 2003


1.2.  Collective Attributes

   Attributes shared by the entries comprising an entry collection are
   called collective attributes.  Values of collective attributes are
   visible but not updateable to clients accessing entries within the
   collection.  Collective attributes are updated (i.e., modified) via
   their associated collective attributes subentry.

   When an entry belongs to multiple entry collections, the entry's
   values of each collective attribute are combined such that
   independent sources of these values are not manifested to clients.

   Entries can specifically exclude a particular collective attribute by
   listing the attribute as a value of the collectiveExclusions
   attribute.  Like other user attributes, collective attributes are
   subject to a variety of controls including access, administrative,
   and content controls.

1.3.  Conventions

   Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 [RFC2251] description
   formats [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line
   wrapped) for readability.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  System Schema for Collective Attributes

   The following operational attributes are used to manage Collective
   Attributes.  LDAP servers [RFC3377] MUST act in accordance with the
   X.500 Directory Models [X.501] when providing this service.

2.1.  collectiveAttributeSubentry

   Subentries of this object class are used to administer collective
   attributes and are referred to as collective attribute subentries.

      ( 2.5.17.2 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentry' AUXILIARY )

   A collective attribute subentry SHOULD contain at least one
   collective attribute.  The collective attributes contained within a
   collective attribute subentry are available for finding, searching,
   and comparison at every entry within the scope of the subentry.  The
   collective attributes, however, are administered (e.g., modified) via
   the subentry.

RFC 3671             Collective Attributes in LDAP         December 2003


   Implementations of this specification SHOULD support collective
   attribute subentries in both collectiveAttributeSpecificArea
   (2.5.23.5) and collectiveAttributeInnerArea (2.5.23.6) administrative
   areas [RFC3672][X.501].

2.2.  collectiveAttributeSubentries

   The collectiveAttributeSubentries operational attribute identifies
   all collective attribute subentries that affect the entry.

      ( 2.5.18.12 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentries'
        EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
        USAGE directoryOperation NO-USER-MODIFICATION )

2.3.  collectiveExclusions

   The collectiveExclusions operational attribute allows particular
   collective attributes to be excluded from an entry.  It MAY appear in
   any entry and MAY have multiple values.

      ( 2.5.18.7 NAME 'collectiveExclusions'
        EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
        USAGE directoryOperation )

   The descriptor excludeAllCollectiveAttributes is associated with the
   OID 2.5.18.0.  When this descriptor or OID is present as a value of
   the collectiveExclusions attribute, all collective attributes are
   excluded from an entry.

3.  Collective Attribute Types

   A userApplications attribute type can be defined to be COLLECTIVE
   [RFC2252].  This indicates that the same attribute values will appear
   in the entries of an entry collection subject to the use of the
   collectiveExclusions attribute and other administrative controls.
   These administrative controls MAY include DIT Content Rules, if
   implemented.

   Collective attribute types are commonly defined as subtypes of non-
   collective attribute types.  By convention, collective attributes are
   named by prefixing the name of their non-collective supertype with
   "c-".  For example, the collective telephone attribute is named
   c-TelephoneNumber after its non-collective supertype telephoneNumber.

   Non-collective attributes types SHALL NOT subtype collective
   attributes.

RFC 3671             Collective Attributes in LDAP         December 2003


   Collective attributes SHALL NOT be SINGLE-VALUED.  Collective
   attribute types SHALL NOT appear in the attribute types of an object
   class definition.

   Operational attributes SHALL NOT be defined to be collective.

   The remainder of section provides a summary of collective attributes
   derived from those defined in [X.520].  The SUPerior attribute types
   are described in [RFC 2256] for use with LDAP.

   Implementations of this specification SHOULD support the following
   collective attributes and MAY support additional collective
   attributes.

3.1.  Collective Locality Name

   The c-l attribute type specifies a locality name for a collection of
   entries.

      ( 2.5.4.7.1 NAME 'c-l'

3.2.  Collective State or Province Name

   The c-st attribute type specifies a state or province name for a
   collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.8.1 NAME 'c-st'

3.4.  Collective Organization Name

   The c-o attribute type specifies an organization name for a
   collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.10.1 NAME 'c-o'
        SUP o COLLECTIVE )

      ( 2.5.4.11.1 NAME 'c-ou'
        SUP ou COLLECTIVE )

3.6.  Collective Postal Address

   The c-PostalAddress attribute type specifies a postal address for a
   collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.16.1 NAME 'c-PostalAddress'
        SUP postalAddress COLLECTIVE )

3.7.  Collective Postal Code

   The c-PostalCode attribute type specifies a postal code for a
   collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.17.1 NAME 'c-PostalCode'
        SUP postalCode COLLECTIVE )

3.8.  Collective Post Office Box

   The c-PostOfficeBox attribute type specifies a post office box for a
   collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.18.1 NAME 'c-PostOfficeBox'
        SUP postOfficeBox COLLECTIVE )

3.9.  Collective Physical Delivery Office Name

   The c-PhysicalDeliveryOfficeName attribute type specifies a physical
   delivery office name for a collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.19.1 NAME 'c-PhysicalDeliveryOfficeName'
        SUP physicalDeliveryOfficeName COLLECTIVE )

3.10.  Collective Telephone Number

   The c-TelephoneNumber attribute type specifies a telephone number for
   a collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.20.1 NAME 'c-TelephoneNumber'
        SUP telephoneNumber COLLECTIVE )

3.11.  Collective Telex Number

   The c-TelexNumber attribute type specifies a telex number for a

      ( 2.5.4.21.1 NAME 'c-TelexNumber'
        SUP telexNumber COLLECTIVE )

3.13.  Collective Facsimile Telephone Number

   The c-FacsimileTelephoneNumber attribute type specifies a facsimile
   telephone number for a collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.23.1 NAME 'c-FacsimileTelephoneNumber'

   SUP facsimileTelephoneNumber COLLECTIVE )

3.14.  Collective International ISDN Number

   The c-InternationalISDNNumber attribute type specifies an
   international ISDN number for a collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.25.1 NAME 'c-InternationalISDNNumber'
        SUP internationalISDNNumber COLLECTIVE )

4.  Security Considerations

   Collective attributes, like other attributes, are subject to access
   control restrictions and other administrative policy.  Generally
   speaking, collective attributes accessed via an entry in a collection
   are governed by rules restricting access to attributes of that entry.
   And collective attributes access via a subentry are governed by rules
   restricting access to attributes of that subentry.  However, as LDAP
   does not have a standard access model, the particulars of each
   server's access control system may differ.

   General LDAP security considerations [RFC3377] also apply.
