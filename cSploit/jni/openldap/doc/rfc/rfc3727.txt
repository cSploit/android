                    ASN.1 Module Definition for the
                LDAP and X.500 Component Matching Rules

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document updates the specification of the component matching
   rules for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500
   directories (RFC3687) by collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One
   (ASN.1) definitions of the component matching rules into an
   appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other specifications
   may reference the component matching rule definitions from within
   their own ASN.1 modules.

1.  Introduction

   The structure or data type of data held in an attribute of a
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] or X.500 [X500]
   directory is described by the attribute's syntax.  Attribute syntaxes
   range from simple data types, such as text string, integer, or
   boolean, to complex data types, for example, the syntaxes of the
   directory schema operational attributes.  RFC 3687 [CMR] defines a
   generic way of matching user selected components in a directory
   attribute value of any arbitrarily complex attribute syntax.

   This document updates RFC 3687 by collecting the Abstract Syntax
   Notation One (ASN.1) [ASN1] definitions of RFC 3687 into an
   appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other specifications
   may reference these definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.

   The InformationFramework ASN.1 module from which the MATCHING-RULE
   and RelativeDistinguishedName definitions are imported is defined in
   X.501 [X501].

   The object identifiers used in this document have been assigned for
   use in specifying the component matching rules by Adacel
   Technologies, under an arc assigned to Adacel by Standards Australia.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document collects together the ASN.1 definitions of the
   component matching rules into an ASN.1 module, but does not modify
   those definitions in any way.  See RFC 3687 [CMR] for the security
   considerations of using the component matching rules.
