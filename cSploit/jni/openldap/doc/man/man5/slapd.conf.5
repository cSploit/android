slapd.conf \- configuration file for slapd, the stand-alone LDAP daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.B ETCDIR/slapd.conf
contains configuration information for the
.BR slapd (8)
daemon.  This configuration file is also used by the SLAPD tools
.BR slapacl (8),
.BR slapadd (8),
.BR slapauth (8),
.BR slapcat (8),
.BR slapdn (8),
.BR slapindex (8),
and
.BR slaptest (8).
.LP
The
.B slapd.conf
file consists of a series of global configuration options that apply to
.B slapd
as a whole (including all backends), followed by zero or more database
backend definitions that contain information specific to a backend
instance.
The configuration options are case-insensitive;
their value, on a case by case basis, may be case-sensitive.
.LP
The general format of
.B slapd.conf
is as follows:
.LP
.nf
    # comment - these options apply to every database
    <global configuration options>
    # first database definition & configuration options
    database <backend 1 type>
    <configuration options specific to backend 1>
    # subsequent database definitions & configuration options
    ...
.fi
.LP
As many backend-specific sections as desired may be included.  Global
options can be overridden in a backend (for options that appear more
than once, the last appearance in the
.B slapd.conf
file is used).
.LP
If a line begins with white space, it is considered a continuation
of the previous line.  No physical line should be over 2000 bytes
long.
.LP
Blank lines and comment lines beginning with
a `#' character are ignored.  Note: continuation lines are unwrapped
before comment processing is applied.
.LP
Arguments on configuration lines are separated by white space. If an
argument contains white space, the argument should be enclosed in
double quotes.  If an argument contains a double quote (`"') or a
backslash character (`\\'), the character should be preceded by a
backslash character.
.LP
The specific configuration options available are discussed below in the
Global Configuration Options, General Backend Options, and General Database
Options.  Backend-specific options are discussed in the
.B slapd\-<backend>(5)
manual pages.  Refer to the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more
details on the slapd configuration file.
.SH GLOBAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
Options described in this section apply to all backends, unless specifically 
overridden in a backend definition. Arguments that should be replaced by 
actual text are shown in brackets <>.
.TP
.B access to <what> "[ by <who> <access> <control> ]+"
Grant access (specified by <access>) to a set of entries and/or
attributes (specified by <what>) by one or more requestors (specified
by <who>).
If no access controls are present, the default policy
allows anyone and everyone to read anything but restricts
updates to rootdn.  (e.g., "access to * by * read").
The rootdn can always read and write EVERYTHING!
See
.BR slapd.access (5)
and the "OpenLDAP's Administrator's Guide" for details.
.TP
.B allow <features>
Specify a set of features (separated by white space) to
allow (default none).
.B bind_v2
allows acceptance of LDAPv2 bind requests.  Note that
.BR slapd (8)
does not truly implement LDAPv2 (RFC 1777), now Historic (RFC 3494).
.B bind_anon_cred
allows anonymous bind when credentials are not empty (e.g.
when DN is empty).
.B bind_anon_dn
allows unauthenticated (anonymous) bind when DN is not empty.
.B update_anon
allows unauthenticated (anonymous) update operations to be processed
(subject to access controls and other administrative limits).
.B proxy_authz_anon
allows unauthenticated (anonymous) proxy authorization control to be processed
(subject to access controls, authorization and other administrative limits).
.TP
.B argsfile <filename>
The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the 
.B slapd
server's command line (program name and options).
.TP
.B attributeoptions [option-name]...
Define tagging attribute options or option tag/range prefixes.
Options must not end with `\-', prefixes must end with `\-'.
The `lang\-' prefix is predefined.
If you use the
.B attributeoptions
directive, `lang\-' will no longer be defined and you must specify it
explicitly if you want it defined.

An attribute description with a tagging option is a subtype of that
attribute description without the option.
Except for that, options defined this way have no special semantics.
Prefixes defined this way work like the `lang\-' options:
They define a prefix for tagging options starting with the prefix.
That is, if you define the prefix `x\-foo\-', you can use the option
`x\-foo\-bar'.
Furthermore, in a search or compare, a prefix or range name (with
a trailing `\-') matches all options starting with that name, as well
as the option with the range name sans the trailing `\-'.
That is, `x\-foo\-bar\-' matches `x\-foo\-bar' and `x\-foo\-bar\-baz'.

RFC 4520 reserves options beginning with `x\-' for private experiments.
Other options should be registered with IANA, see RFC 4520 section 3.5.
OpenLDAP also has the `binary' option built in, but this is a transfer
option, not a tagging option.

forms as well as numeric OIDs to be used for the attribute OID and
attribute syntax OID.

.B authid\-rewrite<cmd> <args>
Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user names
to an LDAP DN used for authorization purposes.
Its purpose is analogous to that of
.BR authz-regexp
(see below).
The prefix \fIauthid\-\fP is followed by a set of rules analogous
to those described in
.BR slapo\-rwm (5)
for data rewriting (replace the \fIrwm\-\fP prefix with \fIauthid\-\fP).
.B authid\-rewrite<cmd>
and
.B authz\-regexp
rules should not be intermixed.
.TP
.B authz\-policy <policy>
Used to specify which rules to use for Proxy Authorization.  Proxy
authorization allows a client to authenticate to the server using one
user's credentials, but specify a different identity to use for authorization
and access control purposes. It essentially allows user A to login as user
B, using user A's password.
The
.B none
flag disables proxy authorization. This is the default setting.
The
.B from
flag will use rules in the
.I authzFrom
attribute of the authorization DN.
The
.B to
flag will use rules in the
.I authzTo
attribute of the authentication DN.
The
.B any
flag, an alias for the deprecated value of
.BR both ,
will allow any of the above, whatever succeeds first (checked in
.BR to ,
.B from
sequence.
The
.B all
flag requires both authorizations to succeed.
.LP
.RS
The rules are mechanisms to specify which identities are allowed 
to perform proxy authorization.
The
.I authzFrom
attribute in an entry specifies which other users
are allowed to proxy login to this entry. The
.I authzTo
attribute in
an entry specifies which other users this user can authorize as.  Use of
.I authzTo
rules can be easily
abused if users are allowed to write arbitrary values to this attribute.
In general the
.I authzTo
attribute must be protected with ACLs such that
only privileged users can modify it.
The value of
.I authzFrom
and
.I authzTo
describes an 
.B identity 
or a set of identities; it can take five forms:
.RS
.TP
.B ldap:///<base>??[<scope>]?<filter>
.RE
.RS
.B dn[.<dnstyle>]:<pattern>

.RS
.B group[/objectClass[/attributeType]]:<pattern>
.RE
.RS
.B <pattern>
.RE
.RS

.B <dnstyle>:={exact|onelevel|children|subtree|regex}

.RE
The first form is a valid LDAP
.B URI
where the 
.IR <host>:<port> ,
the
.I <attrs>
and the
.I <extensions>
portions must be absent, so that the search occurs locally on either
.I authzFrom
or 
.IR authzTo .
The second form is a 
.BR DN ,
with the optional style modifiers
.IR exact ,
.IR onelevel ,
.IR children ,
and
.I subtree
for exact, onelevel, children and subtree matches, which cause 
.I <pattern>
to be normalized according to the DN normalization rules, or the special
.I regex
style, which causes the
.I <pattern>
to be treated as a POSIX (''extended'') regular expression, as
discussed in
.BR regex (7)
and/or
.BR re_format (7).
A pattern of
.I *
means any non-anonymous DN.
The third form is a SASL
.BR id ,
with the optional fields
.I <mech>
and
.I <realm>
that allow to specify a SASL
.BR mechanism ,
and eventually a SASL
.BR realm ,
for those mechanisms that support one.
The need to allow the specification of a mechanism is still debated, 
and users are strongly discouraged to rely on this possibility.
The fourth form is a group specification, consisting of the keyword
.BR group ,
optionally followed by the specification of the group
.B objectClass
and member
.BR attributeType .
The group with DN
.B <pattern>
is searched with base scope, and in case of match, the values of the
member
.B attributeType
are searched for the asserted DN.
For backwards compatibility, if no identity type is provided, i.e. only
.B <pattern>
is present, an
.I exact DN
is assumed; as a consequence, 
.B <pattern>
is subjected to DN normalization.
Since the interpretation of
.I authzFrom
and
.I authzTo
can impact security, users are strongly encouraged 
to explicitly set the type of identity specification that is being used.
A subset of these rules can be used as third arg in the 
.B authz\-regexp
statement (see below); significantly, the 
.IR URI ,
provided it results in exactly one entry,
and the
.I dn.exact:<dn> 
forms.
.RE
.TP
.B authz\-regexp <match> <replace>
Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user names,
such as provided by SASL subsystem, or extracted from certificates
in case of cert-based SASL EXTERNAL, or provided within the RFC 4370
"proxied authorization" control, to an LDAP DN used for
authorization purposes.  Note that the resulting DN need not refer
to an existing entry to be considered valid.  When an authorization
request is received from the SASL subsystem, the SASL 
.BR USERNAME ,
.BR REALM , 
and
.B MECHANISM
are taken, when available, and combined into a name of the form
.RS
.RS
.TP
.B UID=<username>[[,CN=<realm>],CN=<mechanism>],CN=auth

.RE
This name is then compared against the
.B match
POSIX (''extended'') regular expression, and if the match is successful,
the name is replaced with the
.B replace
string.  If there are wildcard strings in the 
.B match
regular expression that are enclosed in parenthesis, e.g. 
.RS
.TP
.B UID=([^,]*),CN=.*

.RE
then the portion of the name that matched the wildcard will be stored
in the numbered placeholder variable $1. If there are other wildcard strings
in parenthesis, the matching strings will be in $2, $3, etc. up to $9. The 
placeholders can then be used in the 
.B replace
string, e.g. 
.RS
.TP
.B UID=$1,OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com 

.RE
The replaced name can be either a DN, i.e. a string prefixed by "dn:",
or an LDAP URI.
If the latter, the server will use the URI to search its own database(s)
and, if the search returns exactly one entry, the name is
replaced by the DN of that entry.   The LDAP URI must have no
hostport, attrs, or extensions components, but the filter is mandatory,
e.g.
.RS
.TP
.B ldap:///OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com??one?(UID=$1)

.RE
The protocol portion of the URI must be strictly
.BR ldap .
Note that this search is subject to access controls.  Specifically,
the authentication identity must have "auth" access in the subject.

Multiple 
.B authz\-regexp 
options can be given in the configuration file to allow for multiple matching 
and replacement patterns. The matching patterns are checked in the order they 
appear in the file, stopping at the first successful match.

.\".B Caution:
.\"Because the plus sign + is a character recognized by the regular expression engine,
.\"and it will appear in names that include a REALM, be careful to escape the
.\"plus sign with a backslash \\+ to remove the character's special meaning.

.TP
.B concurrency <integer>
Specify a desired level of concurrency.  Provided to the underlying
thread system as a hint.  The default is not to provide any hint.
.TP
.B conn_max_pending <integer>
Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an anonymous session.
If requests are submitted faster than the server can process them, they
will be queued up to this limit. If the limit is exceeded, the session
is closed. The default is 100.
.TP
.B conn_max_pending_auth <integer>
Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an authenticated session.
The default is 1000.
.TP
.B defaultsearchbase <dn>
Specify a default search base to use when client submits a
non-base search request with an empty base DN.
Base scoped search requests with an empty base DN are not affected.
.TP
.B disallow <features>
Specify a set of features (separated by white space) to
disallow (default none).
.B bind_anon
disables acceptance of anonymous bind requests.  Note that this setting
does not prohibit anonymous directory access (See "require authc").
.B bind_simple
disables simple (bind) authentication.
.B tls_2_anon
disables forcing session to anonymous status (see also
.BR tls_authc )
upon StartTLS operation receipt.
.B tls_authc
disallows the StartTLS operation if authenticated (see also
.BR tls_2_anon ).
.B proxy_authz_non_critical
disables acceptance of the proxied authorization control (RFC4370)
when criticality is FALSE.
.B dontusecopy_non_critical
disables acceptance of the dontUseCopy control (a work in progress)
when criticality is FALSE.

.B gentlehup { on | off }
A SIGHUP signal will only cause a 'gentle' shutdown-attempt:
.B Slapd
will stop listening for new connections, but will not close the
connections to the current clients.  Future write operations return
unwilling-to-perform, though.  Slapd terminates when all clients
have closed their connections (if they ever do), or - as before -
if it receives a SIGTERM signal.  This can be useful if you wish to
terminate the server and start a new
.B slapd
server
.B with another database,
without disrupting the currently active clients.
The default is off.  You may wish to use
.B idletimeout
along with this option.
.TP
.B idletimeout <integer>
Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing
an idle client connection.  A idletimeout of 0 disables this
feature.  The default is 0. You may also want to set the
.B writetimeout
option.
.TP
.B include <filename>
Read additional configuration information from the given file before
continuing with the next line of the current file.
.TP
.B index_hash64 { on | off }
Use a 64 bit hash for indexing. The default is to use 32 bit hashes.
These hashes are used for equality and substring indexing. The 64 bit
version may be needed to avoid index collisions when the number of
indexed values exceeds ~64 million. (Note that substring indexing
generates multiple index values per actual attribute value.)
Indices generated with 32 bit hashes are incompatible with the 64 bit
version, and vice versa. Any existing databases must be fully reloaded
when changing this setting. This directive is only supported on 64 bit CPUs.
.TP
.B index_intlen <integer>
Specify the key length for ordered integer indices. The most significant
bytes of the binary integer will be used for index keys. The default
value is 4, which provides exact indexing for 31 bit values.
A floating point representation is used to index too large values.
.TP
.B index_substr_if_minlen <integer>
Specify the minimum length for subinitial and subfinal indices. An
attribute value must have at least this many characters in order to be
processed by the indexing functions. The default is 2.
.TP
.B index_substr_if_maxlen <integer>
Specify the maximum length for subinitial and subfinal indices. Only
this many characters of an attribute value will be processed by the
indexing functions; any excess characters are ignored. The default is 4.
.TP
.B index_substr_any_len <integer>
Specify the length used for subany indices. An attribute value must have
at least this many characters in order to be processed. Attribute values
longer than this length will be processed in segments of this length. The
default is 4. The subany index will also be used in subinitial and
subfinal index lookups when the filter string is longer than the
.I index_substr_if_maxlen
value.
.TP
.B index_substr_any_step <integer>
Specify the steps used in subany index lookups. This value sets the offset
for the segments of a filter string that are processed for a subany index
lookup. The default is 2. For example, with the default values, a search
using this filter "cn=*abcdefgh*" would generate index lookups for
"abcd", "cdef", and "efgh".

.LP
Note: Indexing support depends on the particular backend in use. Also,
changing these settings will generally require deleting any indices that
depend on these parameters and recreating them with
.BR slapindex (8).

.B ldapsyntax "(\ <oid>\
 [DESC\ <description>]\
 [X\-SUBST <substitute-syntax>]\ )"
.RS
Specify an LDAP syntax using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in RFC 4512.
The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512 definition by allowing string
forms as well as numeric OIDs to be used for the syntax OID.
(See the
.B objectidentifier
description.) 
The slapd parser also honors the
.B X\-SUBST
extension (an OpenLDAP-specific extension), which allows to use the
.B ldapsyntax
statement to define a non-implemented syntax along with another syntax,
the extension value
.IR substitute-syntax ,
as its temporary replacement.
The
.I substitute-syntax
must be defined.
This allows to define attribute types that make use of non-implemented syntaxes
using the correct syntax OID.
Unless 
.B X\-SUBST
is used, this configuration statement would result in an error,
since no handlers would be associated to the resulting syntax structure.

.B listener-threads <integer>
Specify the number of threads to use for the connection manager.
The default is 1 and this is typically adequate for up to 16 CPU cores.
The value should be set to a power of 2.

.B localSSF <SSF>
Specifies the Security Strength Factor (SSF) to be given local LDAP sessions,
such as those to the ldapi:// listener.  For a description of SSF values,
see

.B logfile <filename>
Specify a file for recording debug log messages. By default these messages
only go to stderr and are not recorded anywhere else. Specifying a logfile
copies messages to both stderr and the logfile.

.B loglevel <integer> [...]
Specify the level at which debugging statements and operation 
statistics should be syslogged (currently logged to the
.BR syslogd (8) 
LOG_LOCAL4 facility).
They must be considered subsystems rather than increasingly verbose 
log levels.
Some messages with higher priority are logged regardless 
of the configured loglevel as soon as any logging is configured.
Log levels are additive, and available levels are:

The keyword 
.B any
can be used as a shortcut to enable logging at all levels (equivalent to \-1).
The keyword
.BR none ,
or the equivalent integer representation, causes those messages
that are logged regardless of the configured loglevel to be logged.
In fact, if loglevel is set to 0, no logging occurs, 
so at least the

level is required to have high priority messages logged.

The loglevel defaults to \fBstats\fP.
This level should usually also be included when using other loglevels, to

Specify an objectclass using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in RFC 4512.
The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512 definition by allowing string

value "oid.xx" will be used.
.TP
.B password\-hash <hash> [<hash>...]
This option configures one or more hashes to be used in generation of user
passwords stored in the userPassword attribute during processing of
LDAP Password Modify Extended Operations (RFC 3062).
The <hash> must be one of
.BR {SSHA} ,
.BR {SHA} ,
.BR {SMD5} ,
.BR {MD5} ,
.BR {CRYPT} ,
and
.BR {CLEARTEXT} .
The default is
.BR {SSHA} .

.B {SHA}
and
.B {SSHA}
use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the latter with a seed.

.B {MD5}
and
.B {SMD5}
use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the latter with a seed.

.B {CRYPT}
uses the
.BR crypt (3).

.B {CLEARTEXT}
indicates that the new password should be
added to userPassword as clear text.

Note that this option does not alter the normal user applications
handling of userPassword during LDAP Add, Modify, or other LDAP operations.
.TP
.B password\-crypt\-salt\-format <format>
Specify the format of the salt passed to
.BR crypt (3)
when generating {CRYPT} passwords (see
.BR password\-hash )
during processing of LDAP Password Modify Extended Operations (RFC 3062).

This string needs to be in
.BR sprintf (3)
format and may include one (and only one) %s conversion.
This conversion will be substituted with a string of random
characters from [A\-Za\-z0\-9./].  For example, "%.2s"
provides a two character salt and "$1$%.8s" tells some
versions of crypt(3) to use an MD5 algorithm and provides
8 random characters of salt.  The default is "%s", which
provides 31 characters of salt.
.TP
.B pidfile <filename>
The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the 
.B slapd
server's process ID (see
.BR getpid (2)).
.TP
.B referral <url>
Specify the referral to pass back when
.BR slapd (8)
cannot find a local database to handle a request.
If specified multiple times, each url is provided.
.TP
.B require <conditions>
Specify a set of conditions (separated by white space) to
require (default none).
The directive may be specified globally and/or per-database;
databases inherit global conditions, so per-database specifications
are additive.
.B bind
requires bind operation prior to directory operations.
.B LDAPv3
requires session to be using LDAP version 3.
.B authc
requires authentication prior to directory operations.
.B SASL
requires SASL authentication prior to directory operations.
.B strong
requires strong authentication prior to directory operations.
The strong keyword allows protected "simple" authentication
as well as SASL authentication.
.B none
may be used to require no conditions (useful to clear out globally
set conditions within a particular database); it must occur first
in the list of conditions.

for the root DSE.  These attributes are returned in addition to the
attributes normally produced by slapd.

The root DSE is an entry with information about the server and its
capabilities, in operational attributes.
It has the empty DN, and can be read with e.g.:
.ti +4
ldapsearch \-x \-b "" \-s base "+"
.br
See RFC 4512 section 5.1 for details.
.TP
.B sasl\-auxprops <plugin> [...]
Specify which auxprop plugins to use for authentication lookups. The
default is empty, which just uses slapd's internal support. Usually
no other auxprop plugins are needed.
.TP
.B sasl\-host <fqdn>
Used to specify the fully qualified domain name used for SASL processing.
.TP
.B sasl\-realm <realm>
Specify SASL realm.  Default is empty.
.TP
.B sasl\-secprops <properties>
Used to specify Cyrus SASL security properties.
The
.B none
flag (without any other properties) causes the flag properties
default, "noanonymous,noplain", to be cleared.
The
.B noplain
flag disables mechanisms susceptible to simple passive attacks.
The
.B noactive
flag disables mechanisms susceptible to active attacks.
The
.B nodict
flag disables mechanisms susceptible to passive dictionary attacks.
The
.B noanonymous
flag disables mechanisms which support anonymous login.
The
.B forwardsec
flag require forward secrecy between sessions.
The
.B passcred
require mechanisms which pass client credentials (and allow
mechanisms which can pass credentials to do so).
The
.B minssf=<factor> 
property specifies the minimum acceptable
.I security strength factor
as an integer approximate to effective key length used for
encryption.  0 (zero) implies no protection, 1 implies integrity
protection only, 56 allows DES or other weak ciphers, 112
allows triple DES and other strong ciphers, 128 allows RC4,
Blowfish and other modern strong ciphers.  The default is 0.
The
.B maxssf=<factor> 
property specifies the maximum acceptable
.I security strength factor
as an integer (see minssf description).  The default is INT_MAX.
The
.B maxbufsize=<size> 
property specifies the maximum security layer receive buffer
size allowed.  0 disables security layers.  The default is 65536.
.TP
.B schemadn <dn>
Specify the distinguished name for the subschema subentry that
controls the entries on this server.  The default is "cn=Subschema".
.TP
.B security <factors>
Specify a set of security strength factors (separated by white space)
to require (see
.BR sasl\-secprops 's
.B minssf
option for a description of security strength factors).
The directive may be specified globally and/or per-database.
.B ssf=<n>
specifies the overall security strength factor.
.B transport=<n>
specifies the transport security strength factor.
.B tls=<n>
specifies the TLS security strength factor.
.B sasl=<n>
specifies the SASL security strength factor.
.B update_ssf=<n>
specifies the overall security strength factor to require for
directory updates.
.B update_transport=<n>
specifies the transport security strength factor to require for
directory updates.
.B update_tls=<n>
specifies the TLS security strength factor to require for
directory updates.
.B update_sasl=<n>
specifies the SASL security strength factor to require for
directory updates.
.B simple_bind=<n>
specifies the security strength factor required for
.I simple
username/password authentication.
Note that the
.B transport
factor is measure of security provided by the underlying transport,
e.g. ldapi:// (and eventually IPSEC).  It is not normally used.
.TP
.B serverID <integer> [<URL>]
Specify an integer ID from 0 to 4095 for this server (limited
to 3 hexadecimal digits).  The ID may also be specified as a
hexadecimal ID by prefixing the value with "0x".
These IDs are
required when using multimaster replication and each master must have a
unique ID. Note that this requirement also applies to separate masters
contributing to a glued set of databases.
If the URL is provided, this directive may be specified
multiple times, providing a complete list of participating servers
and their IDs. The fully qualified hostname of each server should be
used in the supplied URLs. The IDs are used in the "replica id" field
of all CSNs generated by the specified server. The default value is zero.
Example:
.LP
.nf
	serverID 1
.fi
.TP
.B sizelimit {<integer>|unlimited}
.TP
.B sizelimit size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer> [...]
Specify the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.
The default size limit is 500.
Use
.B unlimited
to specify no limits.
The second format allows a fine grain setting of the size limits.
Extra args can be added on the same line.
See
.BR limits
for an explanation of the different flags.
.TP
.B sockbuf_max_incoming <integer>
Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for anonymous sessions.
The default is 262143.
.TP
.B sockbuf_max_incoming_auth <integer>
Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for authenticated sessions.
The default is 4194303.
.TP
.B sortvals <attr> [...]
Specify a list of multi-valued attributes whose values will always
be maintained in sorted order. Using this option will allow Modify,
Compare, and filter evaluations on these attributes to be performed
more efficiently. The resulting sort order depends on the
attributes' syntax and matching rules and may not correspond to
lexical order or any other recognizable order.
.TP
.B tcp-buffer [listener=<URL>] [{read|write}=]<size>
Specify the size of the TCP buffer.
A global value for both read and write TCP buffers related to any listener
is defined, unless the listener is explicitly specified,
or either the read or write qualifiers are used.
See
.BR tcp (7)
for details.
Note that some OS-es implement automatic TCP buffer tuning.
.TP
.B threads <integer>
Specify the maximum size of the primary thread pool.
The default is 16; the minimum value is 2.
.TP
.B timelimit {<integer>|unlimited}
.TP
.B timelimit time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> [...]
Specify the maximum number of seconds (in real time)
.B slapd
will spend answering a search request.  The default time limit is 3600.
Use
.B unlimited
to specify no limits.
The second format allows a fine grain setting of the time limits.
Extra args can be added on the same line.
See
.BR limits
for an explanation of the different flags.
.TP
.B tool\-threads <integer>
Specify the maximum number of threads to use in tool mode.
This should not be greater than the number of CPUs in the system.
The default is 1.
.\"ucdata-path is obsolete / ignored...
.\".TP
.\".B ucdata-path <path>
.\"Specify the path to the directory containing the Unicode character
.\"tables. The default path is DATADIR/ucdata.
.TP
.B writetimeout <integer>
Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing
a connection with an outstanding write. This allows recovery from
various network hang conditions.  A writetimeout of 0 disables this
feature.  The default is 0.
.SH TLS OPTIONS
If
.B slapd
is built with support for Transport Layer Security, there are more options
you can specify.
.TP
.B TLSCipherSuite <cipher-suite-spec>
Permits configuring what ciphers will be accepted and the preference order.
<cipher-suite-spec> should be a cipher specification for the TLS library
in use (OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or Mozilla NSS).
Example:
.RS
.RS
.TP
.I OpenSSL:
TLSCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2
.TP
.I GnuTLS:
TLSCiphersuite SECURE256:!AES-128-CBC
.RE

To check what ciphers a given spec selects in OpenSSL, use:

.nf
	openssl ciphers \-v <cipher-suite-spec>
.fi

With GnuTLS the available specs can be found in the manual page of 
.BR gnutls\-cli (1)
(see the description of the 
option
.BR \-\-priority ).

In older versions of GnuTLS, where gnutls\-cli does not support the option
\-\-priority, you can obtain the \(em more limited \(em list of ciphers by calling:

.nf
	gnutls\-cli \-l
.fi

When using Mozilla NSS, the OpenSSL cipher suite specifications are used and
translated into the format used internally by Mozilla NSS.  There isn't an easy
way to list the cipher suites from the command line.  The authoritative list
is in the source code for Mozilla NSS in the file sslinfo.c in the structure
.nf
        static const SSLCipherSuiteInfo suiteInfo[]
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B TLSCACertificateFile <filename>
Specifies the file that contains certificates for all of the Certificate
Authorities that
.B slapd
will recognize.  The certificate for
the CA that signed the server certificate must be included among
these certificates. If the signing CA was not a top-level (root) CA,
certificates for the entire sequence of CA's from the signing CA to
the top-level CA should be present. Multiple certificates are simply
appended to the file; the order is not significant.
.TP
.B TLSCACertificatePath <path>
Specifies the path of a directory that contains Certificate Authority
certificates in separate individual files. Usually only one of this
or the TLSCACertificateFile is used. This directive is not supported
when using GnuTLS.

When using Mozilla NSS, <path> may contain a Mozilla NSS cert/key
database.  If <path> contains a Mozilla NSS cert/key database and
CA cert files, OpenLDAP will use the cert/key database and will
ignore the CA cert files.
.TP
.B TLSCertificateFile <filename>
Specifies the file that contains the
.B slapd
server certificate.

When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database (specified with
TLSCACertificatePath), TLSCertificateFile specifies
the name of the certificate to use:
.nf
	TLSCertificateFile Server-Cert
.fi
If using a token other than the internal built in token, specify the
token name first, followed by a colon:
.nf
	TLSCertificateFile my hardware device:Server-Cert
.fi
Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:
.nf
	certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L
.fi
.TP
.B TLSCertificateKeyFile <filename>
Specifies the file that contains the
.B slapd
server private key that matches the certificate stored in the
.B TLSCertificateFile
file.  Currently, the private key must not be protected with a password, so
it is of critical importance that it is protected carefully. 

When using Mozilla NSS, TLSCertificateKeyFile specifies the name of
a file that contains the password for the key for the certificate specified with
TLSCertificateFile.  The modutil command can be used to turn off password
protection for the cert/key database.  For example, if TLSCACertificatePath
specifes /etc/openldap/certdb as the location of the cert/key database, use
modutil to change the password to the empty string:
.nf
	modutil -dbdir /etc/openldap/certdb -changepw 'NSS Certificate DB'
.fi
You must have the old password, if any.  Ignore the WARNING about the running
browser.  Press 'Enter' for the new password.
.TP
.B TLSDHParamFile <filename>
This directive specifies the file that contains parameters for Diffie-Hellman
ephemeral key exchange.  This is required in order to use a DSA certificate on
the server, or an RSA certificate missing the "key encipherment" key usage.
Note that setting this option may also enable
Anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchanges in certain non-default cipher suites.
Anonymous key exchanges should generally be avoided since they provide no
actual client or server authentication and provide no protection against
man-in-the-middle attacks.
You should append "!ADH" to your cipher suites to ensure that these suites
are not used.
When using Mozilla NSS these parameters are always generated randomly
so this directive is ignored.
.TP
.B TLSECName <name>
Specify the name of a curve to use for Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
ephemeral key exchange.  This is required to enable ECDHE algorithms in
OpenSSL.  This option is not used with GnuTLS; the curves may be
chosen in the GnuTLS ciphersuite specification. This option is also
ignored for Mozilla NSS.
.TP
.B TLSProtocolMin <major>[.<minor>]
Specifies minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that will be negotiated.
If the server doesn't support at least that version,
the SSL handshake will fail.
To require TLS 1.x or higher, set this option to 3.(x+1),
e.g.,

.nf
	TLSProtocolMin 3.2
.fi

would require TLS 1.1.
Specifying a minimum that is higher than that supported by the
OpenLDAP implementation will result in it requiring the
highest level that it does support.
This directive is ignored with GnuTLS.
.TP
.B TLSRandFile <filename>
Specifies the file to obtain random bits from when /dev/[u]random
is not available.  Generally set to the name of the EGD/PRNGD socket.
The environment variable RANDFILE can also be used to specify the filename.
This directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
.TP
.B TLSVerifyClient <level>
Specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an
incoming TLS session, if any.
The
.B <level>
can be specified as one of the following keywords:
.RS
.TP
.B never
This is the default.
.B slapd
will not ask the client for a certificate.
.TP
.B allow
The client certificate is requested.  If no certificate is provided,
the session proceeds normally.  If a bad certificate is provided,
it will be ignored and the session proceeds normally.
.TP
.B try
The client certificate is requested.  If no certificate is provided,
the session proceeds normally.  If a bad certificate is provided,
the session is immediately terminated.
.TP
.B demand | hard | true
These keywords are all equivalent, for compatibility reasons.
The client certificate is requested.  If no certificate is provided,
or a bad certificate is provided, the session is immediately terminated.

Note that a valid client certificate is required in order to use the
SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism with a TLS session.  As such,
a non-default
.B TLSVerifyClient
setting must be chosen to enable SASL EXTERNAL authentication.
.RE
.TP
.B TLSCRLCheck <level>
Specifies if the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) of the CA should be 
used to verify if the client certificates have not been revoked. This
requires
.B TLSCACertificatePath
parameter to be set. This directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
.B <level>
can be specified as one of the following keywords:
.RS
.TP
.B none
No CRL checks are performed
.TP
.B peer
Check the CRL of the peer certificate
.TP
.B all
Check the CRL for a whole certificate chain
.RE
.TP
.B TLSCRLFile <filename>
Specifies a file containing a Certificate Revocation List to be used
for verifying that certificates have not been revoked. This directive is
only valid when using GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
.SH GENERAL BACKEND OPTIONS
Options in this section only apply to the configuration file section
for the specified backend.  They are supported by every
type of backend.
.TP
.B backend <databasetype>
Mark the beginning of a backend definition. <databasetype>
should be one of
.BR bdb ,
.BR config ,
.BR dnssrv ,
.BR hdb ,
.BR ldap ,
.BR ldif ,
.BR mdb ,
.BR meta ,
.BR monitor ,
.BR null ,
.BR passwd ,
.BR perl ,
.BR relay ,
.BR shell ,
or
.BR sql ,
depending on which backend will serve the database.

.SH GENERAL DATABASE OPTIONS
Options in this section only apply to the configuration file section
for the database in which they are defined.  They are supported by every
type of backend.  Note that the
.B database
and at least one
.B suffix
option are mandatory for each database.
.TP
.B database <databasetype>
Mark the beginning of a new database instance definition. <databasetype>
should be one of
.BR bdb ,
.BR config ,
.BR dnssrv ,
.BR hdb ,
.BR ldap ,
.BR ldif ,
.BR mdb ,
.BR meta ,
.BR monitor ,
.BR null ,
.BR passwd ,
.BR perl ,
.BR relay ,
.BR shell ,
or
.BR sql ,
depending on which backend will serve the database.

LDAP operations, even subtree searches, normally access only one
database.
That can be changed by gluing databases together with the
.B subordinate
keyword.
Access controls and some overlays can also involve multiple databases.
.TP
.B add_content_acl on | off
Controls whether Add operations will perform ACL checks on
the content of the entry being added. This check is off
by default. See the
.BR slapd.access (5)
manual page for more details on ACL requirements for
Add operations.
.TP
.B extra_attrs <attrlist>
Lists what attributes need to be added to search requests.
Local storage backends return the entire entry to the frontend.
The frontend takes care of only returning the requested attributes
that are allowed by ACLs.
However, features like access checking and so may need specific
attributes that are not automatically returned by remote storage
backends, like proxy backends and so on.
.B <attrlist>
is a list of attributes that are needed for internal purposes
and thus always need to be collected, even when not explicitly
requested by clients.
.TP
.B hidden on | off
Controls whether the database will be used to answer
queries. A database that is hidden will never be
selected to answer any queries, and any suffix configured
on the database will be ignored in checks for conflicts
with other databases. By default, hidden is off.
.TP
.B lastmod on | off
Controls whether
.B slapd
will automatically maintain the 
modifiersName, modifyTimestamp, creatorsName, and 
createTimestamp attributes for entries. It also controls
the entryCSN and entryUUID attributes, which are needed
by the syncrepl provider. By default, lastmod is on.
.TP
.B limits <selector> <limit> [<limit> [...]]
Specify time and size limits based on the operation's initiator or
base DN.
The argument
.B <selector>
can be any of
.RS
.RS
.TP
anonymous | users | [<dnspec>=]<pattern> | group[/oc[/at]]=<pattern>

.RE
with
.RS
.TP
<dnspec> ::= dn[.<type>][.<style>]
.TP
<type>  ::= self | this
.TP
<style> ::= exact | base | onelevel | subtree | children | regex | anonymous

.RE
DN type
.B self
is the default and means the bound user, while
.B this
means the base DN of the operation.
The term
.B anonymous
matches all unauthenticated clients.
The term
.B users
matches all authenticated clients;
otherwise an
.B exact
dn pattern is assumed unless otherwise specified by qualifying 
the (optional) key string
.B dn
with 
.B exact
or
.B base
(which are synonyms), to require an exact match; with
.BR onelevel , 
to require exactly one level of depth match; with
.BR subtree ,
to allow any level of depth match, including the exact match; with
.BR children ,
to allow any level of depth match, not including the exact match;
.BR regex
explicitly requires the (default) match based on POSIX (''extended'')
regular expression pattern.
Finally,
.B anonymous
matches unbound operations; the 
.B pattern
field is ignored.
The same behavior is obtained by using the 
.B anonymous
form of the
.B <selector>
clause.
The term
.BR group ,
with the optional objectClass
.B oc
and attributeType
.B at
fields, followed by
.BR pattern ,
sets the limits for any DN listed in the values of the
.B at
attribute (default
.BR member )
of the 
.B oc
group objectClass (default
.BR groupOfNames )
whose DN exactly matches
.BR pattern .

The currently supported limits are 
.B size
and 
.BR time .

The syntax for time limits is 
.BR time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> ,
where 
.I integer
is the number of seconds slapd will spend answering a search request.
If no time limit is explicitly requested by the client, the 
.BR soft
limit is used; if the requested time limit exceeds the
.BR hard
.\"limit, an
.\".I "Administrative limit exceeded"
.\"error is returned.
limit, the value of the limit is used instead.
If the
.BR hard
limit is set to the keyword 
.IR soft ,
the soft limit is used in either case; if it is set to the keyword 
.IR unlimited , 
no hard limit is enforced.
Explicit requests for time limits smaller or equal to the
.BR hard 
limit are honored.
If no limit specifier is set, the value is assigned to the 
.BR soft 
limit, and the
.BR hard
limit is set to
.IR soft ,
to preserve the original behavior.

The syntax for size limits is
.BR size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer> ,
where
.I integer
is the maximum number of entries slapd will return answering a search 
request.
If no size limit is explicitly requested by the client, the
.BR soft
limit is used; if the requested size limit exceeds the
.BR hard
.\"limit, an 
.\".I "Administrative limit exceeded"
.\"error is returned.
limit, the value of the limit is used instead.
If the 
.BR hard
limit is set to the keyword 
.IR soft , 
the soft limit is used in either case; if it is set to the keyword
.IR unlimited , 
no hard limit is enforced.
Explicit requests for size limits smaller or equal to the
.BR hard
limit are honored.
The
.BR unchecked
specifier sets a limit on the number of candidates a search request is allowed
to examine.
The rationale behind it is that searches for non-properly indexed
attributes may result in large sets of candidates, which must be 
examined by
.BR slapd (8)
to determine whether they match the search filter or not.
The
.B unchecked
limit provides a means to drop such operations before they are even 
started.
If the selected candidates exceed the 
.BR unchecked
limit, the search will abort with 
.IR "Unwilling to perform" .
If it is set to the keyword 
.IR unlimited , 
no limit is applied (the default).
If it is set to
.IR disabled ,
the search is not even performed; this can be used to disallow searches
for a specific set of users.
If no limit specifier is set, the value is assigned to the
.BR soft 
limit, and the
.BR hard
limit is set to
.IR soft ,
to preserve the original behavior.

In case of no match, the global limits are used.
The default values are the same as for
.B sizelimit
and
.BR timelimit ;
no limit is set on 
.BR unchecked .

If 
.B pagedResults
control is requested, the 
.B hard
size limit is used by default, because the request of a specific page size
is considered an explicit request for a limitation on the number
of entries to be returned.
However, the size limit applies to the total count of entries returned within
the search, and not to a single page.
Additional size limits may be enforced; the syntax is
.BR size.pr={<integer>|noEstimate|unlimited} ,
where
.I integer
is the max page size if no explicit limit is set; the keyword
.I noEstimate
inhibits the server from returning an estimate of the total number
of entries that might be returned
(note: the current implementation does not return any estimate).
The keyword
.I unlimited
indicates that no limit is applied to the pagedResults control page size.
The syntax
.B size.prtotal={<integer>|unlimited|disabled}
allows to set a limit on the total number of entries that a pagedResults
control allows to return.
By default it is set to the 
.B hard
limit.
When set, 
.I integer
is the max number of entries that the whole search with pagedResults control
can return.
Use 
.I unlimited
to allow unlimited number of entries to be returned, e.g. to allow
the use of the pagedResults control as a means to circumvent size 
limitations on regular searches; the keyword
.I disabled
disables the control, i.e. no paged results can be returned.
Note that the total number of entries returned when the pagedResults control 
is requested cannot exceed the 
.B hard 
size limit of regular searches unless extended by the
.B prtotal
switch.

The \fBlimits\fP statement is typically used to let an unlimited
number of entries be returned by searches performed
with the identity used by the consumer for synchronization purposes
by means of the RFC 4533 LDAP Content Synchronization protocol
(see \fBsyncrepl\fP for details).
.RE
.TP
.B maxderefdepth <depth>
Specifies the maximum number of aliases to dereference when trying to
resolve an entry, used to avoid infinite alias loops. The default is 15.
.TP
.B mirrormode on | off
This option puts a replica database into "mirror" mode.  Update
operations will be accepted from any user, not just the updatedn.  The
database must already be configured as a syncrepl consumer
before this keyword may be set. This mode also requires a
.B serverID
(see above) to be configured.
By default, mirrormode is off.
.TP
.B monitoring on | off
This option enables database-specific monitoring in the entry related
to the current database in the "cn=Databases,cn=Monitor" subtree 
of the monitor database, if the monitor database is enabled.
Currently, only the BDB and the HDB databases provide database-specific
monitoring.
The default depends on the backend type.
.TP
.B overlay <overlay-name>
Add the specified overlay to this database. An overlay is a piece of
code that intercepts database operations in order to extend or change
them. Overlays are pushed onto
a stack over the database, and so they will execute in the reverse
of the order in which they were configured and the database itself
will receive control last of all. See the
.BR slapd.overlays (5)
manual page for an overview of the available overlays.
Note that all of the database's
regular settings should be configured before any overlay settings.
.TP
.B readonly on | off
This option puts the database into "read-only" mode.  Any attempts to 
modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.  By
default, readonly is off.
.TP
.B restrict <oplist>
Specify a whitespace separated list of operations that are restricted.
If defined inside a database specification, restrictions apply only
to that database, otherwise they are global.
Operations can be any of 
.BR add ,
.BR bind ,
.BR compare ,
.BR delete ,
.BR extended[=<OID>] ,
.BR modify ,
.BR rename ,
.BR search ,
or the special pseudo-operations
.B read
and
.BR write ,
which respectively summarize read and write operations.
The use of 
.I restrict write
is equivalent to 
.I readonly on
(see above).
The 
.B extended
keyword allows to indicate the OID of the specific operation
to be restricted.
.TP
.B rootdn <dn>
Specify the distinguished name that is not subject to access control 
or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database.
This DN may or may not be associated with an entry.  An empty root
DN (the default) specifies no root access is to be granted.  It is
recommended that the rootdn only be specified when needed (such as
when initially populating a database).  If the rootdn is within
a namingContext (suffix) of the database, a simple bind password
may also be provided using the
.B rootpw
directive. Many optional features, including syncrepl, require the
rootdn to be defined for the database.
.TP
.B rootpw <password>
Specify a password (or hash of the password) for the rootdn.  The
password can only be set if the rootdn is within the namingContext
(suffix) of the database.
This option accepts all RFC 2307 userPassword formats known to
the server (see 
.B password\-hash
description) as well as cleartext.
.BR slappasswd (8) 
may be used to generate a hash of a password.  Cleartext
and \fB{CRYPT}\fP passwords are not recommended.  If empty
(the default), authentication of the root DN is by other means
(e.g. SASL).  Use of SASL is encouraged.
.TP
.B suffix <dn suffix>
Specify the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this 
backend database.  Multiple suffix lines can be given and at least one is 
required for each database definition.

If the suffix of one database is "inside" that of another, the database
with the inner suffix must come first in the configuration file.
You may also want to glue such databases together with the
.B subordinate
keyword.
.TP
.B subordinate [advertise]
Specify that the current backend database is a subordinate of another
backend database. A subordinate  database may have only one suffix. This
option may be used to glue multiple databases into a single namingContext.
If the suffix of the current database is within the namingContext of a
superior database, searches against the superior database will be
propagated to the subordinate as well. All of the databases
associated with a single namingContext should have identical rootdns.
Behavior of other LDAP operations is unaffected by this setting. In
particular, it is not possible to use moddn to move an entry from
one subordinate to another subordinate within the namingContext.

If the optional \fBadvertise\fP flag is supplied, the naming context of
this database is advertised in the root DSE. The default is to hide this
database context, so that only the superior context is visible.

If the slap tools
.BR slapcat (8),
.BR slapadd (8),
or
.BR slapindex (8)
are used on the superior database, any glued subordinates that support
these tools are opened as well.

Databases that are glued together should usually be configured with the
same indices (assuming they support indexing), even for attributes that
only exist in some of these databases. In general, all of the glued
databases should be configured as similarly as possible, since the intent
is to provide the appearance of a single directory.

Note that the \fIsubordinate\fP functionality is implemented internally
by the \fIglue\fP overlay and as such its behavior will interact with other
overlays in use. By default, the glue overlay is automatically configured as
the last overlay on the superior backend. Its position on the backend
can be explicitly configured by setting an \fBoverlay glue\fP directive
at the desired position. This explicit configuration is necessary e.g.
when using the \fIsyncprov\fP overlay, which needs to follow \fIglue\fP
in order to work over all of the glued databases. E.g.
.RS
.nf
	database mdb
	suffix dc=example,dc=com
	...
	overlay glue
	overlay syncprov

.RS
Specify the current database as a replica which is kept up-to-date with the 
master content by establishing the current
.BR slapd (8)
as a replication consumer site running a
.B syncrepl
replication engine.
The replica content is kept synchronized to the master content using
the LDAP Content Synchronization protocol. Refer to the
"OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for detailed information on
setting up a replicated
.B slapd
directory service using the 
.B syncrepl
replication engine.

.B rid
identifies the current
.B syncrepl
directive within the replication consumer site.
It is a non-negative integer not greater than 999 (limited
to three decimal digits).

.B provider
specifies the replication provider site containing the master content
as an LDAP URI. If <port> is not given, the standard LDAP port number
(389 or 636) is used.

The content of the
.B syncrepl
replica is defined using a search
specification as its result set. The consumer
.B slapd
will send search requests to the provider
.B slapd
according to the search specification. The search specification includes
.BR searchbase ", " scope ", " filter ", " attrs ", " attrsonly ", " sizelimit ", "
and
.B timelimit
parameters as in the normal search specification. 
The \fBscope\fP defaults to \fBsub\fP, the \fBfilter\fP defaults to
\fB(objectclass=*)\fP, while there is no default \fBsearchbase\fP. The
\fBattrs\fP list defaults to \fB"*,+"\fP to return all user and operational
attributes, and \fBattrsonly\fP is unset by default.
The \fBsizelimit\fP and \fBtimelimit\fP only
accept "unlimited" and positive integers, and both default to "unlimited".
The \fBsizelimit\fP and \fBtimelimit\fP parameters define
a consumer requested limitation on the number of entries that can be returned
by the LDAP Content Synchronization operation; as such, it is intended
to implement partial replication based on the size of the replicated database
and on the time required by the synchronization.
Note, however, that any provider-side limits for the replication identity
will be enforced by the provider regardless of the limits requested
by the LDAP Content Synchronization operation, much like for any other
search operation.
.B exattrs
option may also be used to specify attributes that should be omitted
from incoming entries.
The \fBscope\fP defaults to \fBsub\fP, the \fBfilter\fP defaults to
\fB(objectclass=*)\fP, and there is no default \fBsearchbase\fP. The
\fBattrs\fP list defaults to \fB"*,+"\fP to return all user and operational
attributes, and \fBattrsonly\fP and \fBexattrs\fP are unset by default.
The \fBsizelimit\fP and \fBtimelimit\fP only
accept "unlimited" and positive integers, and both default to "unlimited".
Note, however, that any provider-side limits for the replication identity
will be enforced by the provider regardless of the limits requested
by the LDAP Content Synchronization operation, much like for any other
search operation.

The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types.
In the
.B refreshOnly
operation, the next synchronization search operation
is periodically rescheduled at an interval time (specified by 
.B interval
parameter; 1 day by default)
after each synchronization operation finishes.
In the
.B refreshAndPersist
operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the provider slapd.
Further updates to the master replica will generate
.B searchResultEntry
to the consumer slapd as the search responses to the persistent
synchronization search.

If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt to
reconnect according to the
.B retry
parameter which is a list of the <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs.
For example, retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds
for the first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next 3
times before stop retrying. The `+' in <# of retries> means indefinite
number of retries until success.
If no 
.B retry
was specified, by default syncrepl retries every hour forever.

The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync
consumer site by turning on the
.B schemachecking
parameter. The default is \fBoff\fP.
Schema checking \fBon\fP means that replicated entries must have
a structural objectClass, must obey to objectClass requirements
in terms of required/allowed attributes, and that naming attributes
and distinguished values must be present.
As a consequence, schema checking should be \fBoff\fP when partial
replication is used.

The
.B network\-timeout
parameter sets how long the consumer will wait to establish a
network connection to the provider. Once a connection is
established, the
.B timeout
parameter determines how long the consumer will wait for the initial
Bind request to complete. The defaults for these parameters come
from 
.BR ldap.conf (5).

A
.B bindmethod
of 
.B simple
requires the options 
.B binddn
and 
.B credentials
and should only be used when adequate security services
(e.g. TLS or IPSEC) are in place.
.B REMEMBER: simple bind credentials must be in cleartext!
A
.B bindmethod
of
.B sasl
requires the option
.B saslmech.
Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity and/or
credentials can be specified using
.B authcid
and
.B credentials.
The
.B authzid
parameter may be used to specify an authorization identity.
Specific security properties (as with the
.B sasl\-secprops
keyword above) for a SASL bind can be set with the
.B secprops
option. A non default SASL realm can be set with the
.B realm 
option.
The identity used for synchronization by the consumer should be allowed
to receive an unlimited number of entries in response to a search request.
The provider, other than allow authentication of the syncrepl identity,
should grant that identity appropriate access privileges to the data 
that is being replicated (\fBaccess\fP directive), and appropriate time 
and size limits.
This can be accomplished by either allowing unlimited \fBsizelimit\fP
and \fBtimelimit\fP, or by setting an appropriate \fBlimits\fP statement
in the consumer's configuration (see \fBsizelimit\fP and \fBlimits\fP
for details).

The
.B keepalive
parameter sets the values of \fIidle\fP, \fIprobes\fP, and \fIinterval\fP
used to check whether a socket is alive;
.I idle
is the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle before TCP 
starts sending keepalive probes;
.I probes
is the maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping
the connection;
.I interval
is interval in seconds between individual keepalive probes.
Only some systems support the customization of these values;
the
.B keepalive
parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-wide settings are used.

The
.B starttls
parameter specifies use of the StartTLS extended operation
to establish a TLS session before Binding to the provider. If the
.B critical
argument is supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS request
fails. Otherwise the syncrepl session continues without TLS. The
tls_reqcert setting defaults to "demand" and the other TLS settings
default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings.

The
.B suffixmassage
parameter allows the consumer to pull entries from a remote directory
whose DN suffix differs from the local directory. The portion of the
remote entries' DNs that matches the \fIsearchbase\fP will be replaced
with the suffixmassage DN.

Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs of
data modifications. This mode of operation is referred to as \fIdelta
syncrepl\fP. In addition to the above parameters, the
.B logbase
and
.B logfilter
parameters must be set appropriately for the log that will be used. The
.B syncdata
parameter must be set to either "accesslog" if the log conforms to the
.BR slapo\-accesslog (5)
log format, or "changelog" if the log conforms
to the obsolete \fIchangelog\fP format. If the
.B syncdata
parameter is omitted or set to "default" then the log parameters are
ignored.
.RE
.TP
.B updatedn <dn>
This option is only applicable in a slave
database.
It specifies the DN permitted to update (subject to access controls)
the replica.  It is only needed in certain push-mode
replication scenarios.  Generally, this DN
.I should not
be the same as the
.B rootdn 
used at the master.
.TP
.B updateref <url>
Specify the referral to pass back when
.BR slapd (8)
is asked to modify a replicated local database.
If specified multiple times, each url is provided.
