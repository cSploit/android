Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library.  The macro
LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value
(e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling program designed to use
deprecated interfaces.  It is recommended that developers writing new
programs, or updating old programs, avoid use of deprecated interfaces.
Over time, it is expected that documentation (and, eventually, support) for
deprecated interfaces to be eliminated.
