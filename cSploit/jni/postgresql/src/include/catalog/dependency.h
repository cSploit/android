/*
 * Precise semantics of a dependency relationship are specified by the
 * DependencyType code (which is stored in a "char" field in pg_depend,
 * so we assign ASCII-code values to the enumeration members).
 *
 * In all cases, a dependency relationship indicates that the referenced
 * object may not be dropped without also dropping the dependent object.
 * However, there are several subflavors:
 *
 * DEPENDENCY_NORMAL ('n'): normal relationship between separately-created
 * objects.  The dependent object may be dropped without affecting the
 * referenced object.  The referenced object may only be dropped by
 * specifying CASCADE, in which case the dependent object is dropped too.
 * Example: a table column has a normal dependency on its datatype.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY_AUTO ('a'): the dependent object can be dropped separately
 * from the referenced object, and should be automatically dropped
 * (regardless of RESTRICT or CASCADE mode) if the referenced object
 * is dropped.
 * Example: a named constraint on a table is made auto-dependent on
 * the table, so that it will go away if the table is dropped.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY_INTERNAL ('i'): the dependent object was created as part
 * of creation of the referenced object, and is really just a part of
 * its internal implementation.  A DROP of the dependent object will be
 * disallowed outright (we'll tell the user to issue a DROP against the
 * referenced object, instead).  A DROP of the referenced object will be
 * propagated through to drop the dependent object whether CASCADE is
 * specified or not.
 * Example: a trigger that's created to enforce a foreign-key constraint
 * is made internally dependent on the constraint's pg_constraint entry.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY_EXTENSION ('e'): the dependent object is a member of the
 * extension that is the referenced object.  The dependent object can be
 * dropped only via DROP EXTENSION on the referenced object.  Functionally
 * this dependency type acts the same as an internal dependency, but it's
 * kept separate for clarity and to simplify pg_dump.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY_PIN ('p'): there is no dependent object; this type of entry
 * is a signal that the system itself depends on the referenced object,
 * and so that object must never be deleted.  Entries of this type are
 * created only during initdb.	The fields for the dependent object
 * contain zeroes.
 *
 * Other dependency flavors may be needed in future.

/*
 * There is also a SharedDependencyType enum type that determines the exact
 * semantics of an entry in pg_shdepend.  Just like regular dependency entries,
 * any pg_shdepend entry means that the referenced object cannot be dropped
 * unless the dependent object is dropped at the same time.  There are some
 * additional rules however:
 *
 * (a) For a SHARED_DEPENDENCY_PIN entry, there is no dependent object --
 * rather, the referenced object is an essential part of the system.  This
 * applies to the initdb-created superuser.  Entries of this type are only
 * created by initdb; objects in this category don't need further pg_shdepend
 * entries if more objects come to depend on them.
 *
 * (b) a SHARED_DEPENDENCY_OWNER entry means that the referenced object is
 * the role owning the dependent object.  The referenced object must be
 * a pg_authid entry.
 *
 * (c) a SHARED_DEPENDENCY_ACL entry means that the referenced object is
 * a role mentioned in the ACL field of the dependent object.  The referenced
 * object must be a pg_authid entry.  (SHARED_DEPENDENCY_ACL entries are not
 * created for the owner of an object; hence two objects may be linked by
 * one or the other, but not both, of these dependency types.)
 *
 * SHARED_DEPENDENCY_INVALID is a value used as a parameter in internal
 * routines, and is not valid in the catalog itself.
