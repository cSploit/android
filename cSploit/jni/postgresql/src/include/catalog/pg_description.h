 * pg_description.h
 *	  definition of the system "description" relation (pg_description)
 *
 * NOTE: an object is identified by the OID of the row that primarily
 * defines the object, plus the OID of the table that that row appears in.
 * For example, a function is identified by the OID of its pg_proc row
 * plus the pg_class OID of table pg_proc.	This allows unique identification
 * of objects without assuming that OIDs are unique across tables.
 *
 * Since attributes don't have OIDs of their own, we identify an attribute
 * comment by the objoid+classoid of its parent table, plus an "objsubid"
 * giving the attribute column number.	"objsubid" must be zero in a comment
 * for a table itself, so that it is distinct from any column comment.
 * Currently, objsubid is unused and zero for all other kinds of objects,
 * but perhaps it might be useful someday to associate comments with
 * constituent elements of other kinds of objects (arguments of a function,
 * for example).
