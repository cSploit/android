 *
 * NOTE: an object is identified by the OID of the row that primarily
 * defines the object, plus the OID of the table that that row appears in.
 * For example, a database is identified by the OID of its pg_database row
 * plus the pg_class OID of table pg_database.	This allows unique
 * identification of objects without assuming that OIDs are unique
 * across tables.
