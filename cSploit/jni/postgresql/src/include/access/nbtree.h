 *	BTPageOpaqueData -- At the end of every page, we store a pointer

 *	index scans.  The next-page link is also critical for recovery when
 *	a search has navigated to the wrong page due to concurrent page splits
 *	or deletions; see src/backend/access/nbtree/README for more info.
 *
 *	In addition, we store the page's btree level (counting upwards from
 *	zero at a leaf page) as well as some flag bits indicating the page type
 *	and status.  If the page is deleted, we replace the level with the
 *	next-transaction-ID value indicating when it is safe to reclaim the page.
 *
 *	We also store a "vacuum cycle ID".	When a page is split while VACUUM is
 *	processing the index, a nonzero value associated with the VACUUM run is
 *	stored into both halves of the split page.	(If VACUUM is not running,
 *	both pages receive zero cycleids.)	This allows VACUUM to detect whether
 *	a page was split since it started, with a small probability of false match
 *	if the page was last split some exact multiple of MAX_BT_CYCLE_ID VACUUMs
 *	ago.  Also, during a split, the BTP_SPLIT_END flag is cleared in the left
 *	(original) page, and set in the right page, but only if the next page
 *	to its right has a different cycleid.
 *
 *	NOTE: the BTP_LEAF flag bit is redundant since level==0 could be tested
