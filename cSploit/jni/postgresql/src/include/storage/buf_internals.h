 *	BufferDesc -- shared descriptor/state data for a single shared buffer.
 *
 * Note: buf_hdr_lock must be held to examine or change the tag, flags,
 * usage_count, refcount, or wait_backend_pid fields.  buf_id field never
 * changes after initialization, so does not need locking.	freeNext is
 * protected by the BufFreelistLock not buf_hdr_lock.  The LWLocks can take
 * care of themselves.	The buf_hdr_lock is *not* used to control access to
 * the data in the buffer!
 *
 * An exception is that if we have the buffer pinned, its tag can't change
 * underneath us, so we can examine the tag without locking the spinlock.
 * Also, in places we do one-time reads of the flags without bothering to
 * lock the spinlock; this is generally for situations where we don't expect
 * the flag bit being tested to be changing.
 *
 * We can't physically remove items from a disk page if another backend has
 * the buffer pinned.  Hence, a backend may need to wait for all other pins
 * to go away.	This is signaled by storing its own PID into
 * wait_backend_pid and setting flag bit BM_PIN_COUNT_WAITER.  At present,
 * there can be only one such waiter per buffer.
 *
 * We use this same struct for local buffer headers, but the lock fields
 * are not used and not all of the flag bits are useful either.
