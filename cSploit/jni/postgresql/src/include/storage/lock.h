 *

 * proclock.  Note that there will be a proclock object, possibly with
 * zero holdMask, for any lock that the process is currently waiting on.
 * Otherwise, proclock objects whose holdMasks are zero are recycled
 * as soon as convenient.
 *

 * to be released during the current call.	This must only be examined or
 * set by the backend owning the PROCLOCK.

 * object and the owning PGPROC object.  Note that the PROCLOCK is entered
 * into these lists as soon as it is created, even if no lock has yet been
 * granted.  A PGPROC that is waiting for a lock to be granted will also be
