 * We have a number of predefined LWLocks, plus a bunch of LWLocks that are
 * dynamically assigned (e.g., for shared buffers).  The LWLock structures
 * live in shared memory (since they contain shared data) and are identified
 * by values of this enumerated type.  We abuse the notion of an enum somewhat
 * by allowing values not listed in the enum declaration to be assigned.
 * The extra value MaxDynamicLWLock is there to keep the compiler from
 * deciding that the enum can be represented as char or short ...
 *
 * If you remove a lock, please replace it with a placeholder. This retains
 * the lock numbering, which is helpful for DTrace and other external
 * debugging scripts.
