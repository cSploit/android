/*----------
 * RelOptInfo
 *		Per-relation information for planning/optimization
 *
 * For planning purposes, a "base rel" is either a plain relation (a table)
 * or the output of a sub-SELECT or function that appears in the range table.
 * In either case it is uniquely identified by an RT index.  A "joinrel"
 * is the joining of two or more base rels.  A joinrel is identified by
 * the set of RT indexes for its component baserels.  We create RelOptInfo
 * nodes for each baserel and joinrel, and store them in the PlannerInfo's
 * simple_rel_array and join_rel_list respectively.
 *
 * Note that there is only one joinrel for any given set of component
 * baserels, no matter what order we assemble them in; so an unordered
 * set is the right datatype to identify it with.
 *
 * We also have "other rels", which are like base rels in that they refer to
 * single RT indexes; but they are not part of the join tree, and are given
 * a different RelOptKind to identify them.  Lastly, there is a RelOptKind
 * for "dead" relations, which are base rels that we have proven we don't
 * need to join after all.
 *
 * Currently the only kind of otherrels are those made for member relations
 * of an "append relation", that is an inheritance set or UNION ALL subquery.
 * An append relation has a parent RTE that is a base rel, which represents
 * the entire append relation.	The member RTEs are otherrels.	The parent
 * is present in the query join tree but the members are not.  The member
 * RTEs and otherrels are used to plan the scans of the individual tables or
 * subqueries of the append set; then the parent baserel is given Append
 * and/or MergeAppend paths comprising the best paths for the individual
 * member rels.  (See comments for AppendRelInfo for more information.)
 *
 * At one time we also made otherrels to represent join RTEs, for use in
 * handling join alias Vars.  Currently this is not needed because all join
 * alias Vars are expanded to non-aliased form during preprocess_expression.
 *
 * Parts of this data structure are specific to various scan and join
 * mechanisms.	It didn't seem worth creating new node types for them.
 *
 *		relids - Set of base-relation identifiers; it is a base relation
 *				if there is just one, a join relation if more than one
 *		rows - estimated number of tuples in the relation after restriction
 *			   clauses have been applied (ie, output rows of a plan for it)
 *		width - avg. number of bytes per tuple in the relation after the
 *				appropriate projections have been done (ie, output width)
 *		reltargetlist - List of Var and PlaceHolderVar nodes for the values
 *						we need to output from this relation.
 *						List is in no particular order, but all rels of an
 *						appendrel set must use corresponding orders.
 *						NOTE: in a child relation, may contain RowExpr or
 *						ConvertRowtypeExpr representing a whole-row Var.
 *		pathlist - List of Path nodes, one for each potentially useful
 *				   method of generating the relation
 *		cheapest_startup_path - the pathlist member with lowest startup cost
 *								(regardless of its ordering)
 *		cheapest_total_path - the pathlist member with lowest total cost
 *							  (regardless of its ordering)
 *		cheapest_unique_path - for caching cheapest path to produce unique
 *							   (no duplicates) output from relation
 *
 * If the relation is a base relation it will have these fields set:
 *
 *		relid - RTE index (this is redundant with the relids field, but
 *				is provided for convenience of access)
 *		rtekind - distinguishes plain relation, subquery, or function RTE
 *		min_attr, max_attr - range of valid AttrNumbers for rel
 *		attr_needed - array of bitmapsets indicating the highest joinrel
 *				in which each attribute is needed; if bit 0 is set then
 *				the attribute is needed as part of final targetlist
 *		attr_widths - cache space for per-attribute width estimates;
 *					  zero means not computed yet
 *		indexlist - list of IndexOptInfo nodes for relation's indexes
 *					(always NIL if it's not a table)
 *		pages - number of disk pages in relation (zero if not a table)
 *		tuples - number of tuples in relation (not considering restrictions)
 *		subplan - plan for subquery (NULL if it's not a subquery)
 *		subrtable - rangetable for subquery (NIL if it's not a subquery)
 *		subrowmark - rowmarks for subquery (NIL if it's not a subquery)
 *
 *		Note: for a subquery, tuples and subplan are not set immediately
 *		upon creation of the RelOptInfo object; they are filled in when
 *		set_base_rel_pathlist processes the object.
 *
 *		For otherrels that are appendrel members, these fields are filled
 *		in just as for a baserel.
 *
 * The presence of the remaining fields depends on the restrictions
 * and joins that the relation participates in:
 *
 *		baserestrictinfo - List of RestrictInfo nodes, containing info about
 *					each non-join qualification clause in which this relation
 *					participates (only used for base rels)
 *		baserestrictcost - Estimated cost of evaluating the baserestrictinfo
 *					clauses at a single tuple (only used for base rels)
 *		joininfo  - List of RestrictInfo nodes, containing info about each
 *					join clause in which this relation participates (but
 *					note this excludes clauses that might be derivable from
 *					EquivalenceClasses)
 *		has_eclass_joins - flag that EquivalenceClass joins are possible
 *		index_outer_relids - only used for base rels; set of outer relids
 *					that participate in indexable joinclauses for this rel
 *		index_inner_paths - only used for base rels; list of InnerIndexscanInfo
 *					nodes showing best indexpaths for various subsets of
 *					index_outer_relids.
 *
 * Note: Keeping a restrictinfo list in the RelOptInfo is useful only for
 * base rels, because for a join rel the set of clauses that are treated as
 * restrict clauses varies depending on which sub-relations we choose to join.
 * (For example, in a 3-base-rel join, a clause relating rels 1 and 2 must be
 * treated as a restrictclause if we join {1} and {2 3} to make {1 2 3}; but
 * if we join {1 2} and {3} then that clause will be a restrictclause in {1 2}
 * and should not be processed again at the level of {1 2 3}.)	Therefore,
 * the restrictinfo list in the join case appears in individual JoinPaths
 * (field joinrestrictinfo), not in the parent relation.  But it's OK for
 * the RelOptInfo to store the joininfo list, because that is the same
 * for a given rel no matter how we form it.
 *
 * We store baserestrictcost in the RelOptInfo (for base relations) because
 * we know we will need it at least once (to price the sequential scan)
 * and may need it multiple times to price index scans.

/*
 * EquivalenceClasses
 *
 * Whenever we can determine that a mergejoinable equality clause A = B is
 * not delayed by any outer join, we create an EquivalenceClass containing
 * the expressions A and B to record this knowledge.  If we later find another
 * equivalence B = C, we add C to the existing EquivalenceClass; this may
 * require merging two existing EquivalenceClasses.  At the end of the qual
 * distribution process, we have sets of values that are known all transitively
 * equal to each other, where "equal" is according to the rules of the btree
 * operator family(s) shown in ec_opfamilies, as well as the collation shown
 * by ec_collation.  (We restrict an EC to contain only equalities whose
 * operators belong to the same set of opfamilies.	This could probably be
 * relaxed, but for now it's not worth the trouble, since nearly all equality
 * operators belong to only one btree opclass anyway.  Similarly, we suppose
 * that all or none of the input datatypes are collatable, so that a single
 * collation value is sufficient.)
 *
 * We also use EquivalenceClasses as the base structure for PathKeys, letting
 * us represent knowledge about different sort orderings being equivalent.
 * Since every PathKey must reference an EquivalenceClass, we will end up
 * with single-member EquivalenceClasses whenever a sort key expression has
 * not been equivalenced to anything else.	It is also possible that such an
 * EquivalenceClass will contain a volatile expression ("ORDER BY random()"),
 * which is a case that can't arise otherwise since clauses containing
 * volatile functions are never considered mergejoinable.  We mark such
 * EquivalenceClasses specially to prevent them from being merged with
 * ordinary EquivalenceClasses.  Also, for volatile expressions we have
 * to be careful to match the EquivalenceClass to the correct targetlist
 * entry: consider SELECT random() AS a, random() AS b ... ORDER BY b,a.
 * So we record the SortGroupRef of the originating sort clause.
 *
 * We allow equality clauses appearing below the nullable side of an outer join
 * to form EquivalenceClasses, but these have a slightly different meaning:
 * the included values might be all NULL rather than all the same non-null
 * values.	See src/backend/optimizer/README for more on that point.
 *
 * NB: if ec_merged isn't NULL, this class has been merged into another, and
 * should be ignored in favor of using the pointed-to class.

 * the query's WHERE or JOIN conditions.
 *
 * 'indexquals' has the same structure as 'indexclauses', but it contains
 * the actual indexqual conditions that can be used with the index.
 * In simple cases this is identical to 'indexclauses', but when special
 * indexable operators appear in 'indexclauses', they are replaced by the
 * derived indexscannable conditions in 'indexquals'.
 *
 * 'indexorderbys', if not NIL, is a list of ORDER BY expressions that have

 * Note that these are not RestrictInfos, just bare expressions, since they

 * Also, unlike the case for quals, it's guaranteed that each expression has
 * the index key on the left side of the operator.
 *
 * 'isjoininner' is TRUE if the path is a nestloop inner scan (that is,
 * some of the index conditions are join rather than restriction clauses).
 * Note that the path costs will be calculated differently from a plain
 * indexscan in this case, and in addition there's a special 'rows' value
 * different from the parent RelOptInfo's (see below).
 *
 * 'indexscandir' is one of:
 *		ForwardScanDirection: forward scan of an ordered index
 *		BackwardScanDirection: backward scan of an ordered index
 *		NoMovementScanDirection: scan of an unordered index, or don't care
 * (The executor doesn't care whether it gets ForwardScanDirection or
 * NoMovementScanDirection for an indexscan, but the planner wants to
 * distinguish ordered from unordered indexes for building pathkeys.)
 *

 * we need not recompute them when considering using the same index in a
 * bitmap index/heap scan (see BitmapHeapPath).  The costs of the IndexPath
 * itself represent the costs of an IndexScan plan type.
 *
 * 'rows' is the estimated result tuple count for the indexscan.  This
 * is the same as path.parent->rows for a simple indexscan, but it is
 * different for a nestloop inner scan, because the additional indexquals

 * Restriction clause info.
 *
 * We create one of these for each AND sub-clause of a restriction condition
 * (WHERE or JOIN/ON clause).  Since the restriction clauses are logically
 * ANDed, we can use any one of them or any subset of them to filter out
 * tuples, without having to evaluate the rest.  The RestrictInfo node itself
 * stores data used by the optimizer while choosing the best query plan.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references a single base relation, it will appear
 * in the baserestrictinfo list of the RelOptInfo for that base rel.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references more than one base rel, it will
 * appear in the joininfo list of every RelOptInfo that describes a strict
 * subset of the base rels mentioned in the clause.  The joininfo lists are
 * used to drive join tree building by selecting plausible join candidates.
 * The clause cannot actually be applied until we have built a join rel
 * containing all the base rels it references, however.
 *
 * When we construct a join rel that includes all the base rels referenced
 * in a multi-relation restriction clause, we place that clause into the
 * joinrestrictinfo lists of paths for the join rel, if neither left nor
 * right sub-path includes all base rels referenced in the clause.	The clause
 * will be applied at that join level, and will not propagate any further up
 * the join tree.  (Note: the "predicate migration" code was once intended to
 * push restriction clauses up and down the plan tree based on evaluation
 * costs, but it's dead code and is unlikely to be resurrected in the
 * foreseeable future.)
 *
 * Note that in the presence of more than two rels, a multi-rel restriction
 * might reach different heights in the join tree depending on the join
 * sequence we use.  So, these clauses cannot be associated directly with
 * the join RelOptInfo, but must be kept track of on a per-join-path basis.
 *
 * RestrictInfos that represent equivalence conditions (i.e., mergejoinable
 * equalities that are not outerjoin-delayed) are handled a bit differently.
 * Initially we attach them to the EquivalenceClasses that are derived from
 * them.  When we construct a scan or join path, we look through all the
 * EquivalenceClasses and generate derived RestrictInfos representing the
 * minimal set of conditions that need to be checked for this particular scan
 * or join to enforce that all members of each EquivalenceClass are in fact
 * equal in all rows emitted by the scan or join.
 *
 * When dealing with outer joins we have to be very careful about pushing qual
 * clauses up and down the tree.  An outer join's own JOIN/ON conditions must
 * be evaluated exactly at that join node, unless they are "degenerate"
 * conditions that reference only Vars from the nullable side of the join.
 * Quals appearing in WHERE or in a JOIN above the outer join cannot be pushed
 * down below the outer join, if they reference any nullable Vars.
 * RestrictInfo nodes contain a flag to indicate whether a qual has been
 * pushed down to a lower level than its original syntactic placement in the
 * join tree would suggest.  If an outer join prevents us from pushing a qual
 * down to its "natural" semantic level (the level associated with just the
 * base rels used in the qual) then we mark the qual with a "required_relids"
 * value including more than just the base rels it actually uses.  By
 * pretending that the qual references all the rels required to form the outer
 * join, we prevent it from being evaluated below the outer join's joinrel.
 * When we do form the outer join's joinrel, we still need to distinguish
 * those quals that are actually in that join's JOIN/ON condition from those
 * that appeared elsewhere in the tree and were pushed down to the join rel
 * because they used no other rels.  That's what the is_pushed_down flag is
 * for; it tells us that a qual is not an OUTER JOIN qual for the set of base
 * rels listed in required_relids.	A clause that originally came from WHERE
 * or an INNER JOIN condition will *always* have its is_pushed_down flag set.
 * It's possible for an OUTER JOIN clause to be marked is_pushed_down too,
 * if we decide that it can be pushed down into the nullable side of the join.
 * In that case it acts as a plain filter qual for wherever it gets evaluated.
 * (In short, is_pushed_down is only false for non-degenerate outer join
 * conditions.	Possibly we should rename it to reflect that meaning?)
 *
 * RestrictInfo nodes also contain an outerjoin_delayed flag, which is true
 * if the clause's applicability must be delayed due to any outer joins
 * appearing below it (ie, it has to be postponed to some join level higher
 * than the set of relations it actually references).  There is also a
 * nullable_relids field, which is the set of rels it references that can be
 * forced null by some outer join below the clause.  outerjoin_delayed = true
 * is subtly different from nullable_relids != NULL: a clause might reference
 * some nullable rels and yet not be outerjoin_delayed because it also
 * references all the other rels of the outer join(s).	A clause that is not
 * outerjoin_delayed can be enforced anywhere it is computable.
 *
 * In general, the referenced clause might be arbitrarily complex.	The
 * kinds of clauses we can handle as indexscan quals, mergejoin clauses,
 * or hashjoin clauses are limited (e.g., no volatile functions).  The code
 * for each kind of path is responsible for identifying the restrict clauses
 * it can use and ignoring the rest.  Clauses not implemented by an indexscan,
 * mergejoin, or hashjoin will be placed in the plan qual or joinqual field
 * of the finished Plan node, where they will be enforced by general-purpose
 * qual-expression-evaluation code.  (But we are still entitled to count
 * their selectivity when estimating the result tuple count, if we
 * can guess what it is...)
 *
 * When the referenced clause is an OR clause, we generate a modified copy
 * in which additional RestrictInfo nodes are inserted below the top-level
 * OR/AND structure.  This is a convenience for OR indexscan processing:
 * indexquals taken from either the top level or an OR subclause will have
 * associated RestrictInfo nodes.
 *
 * The can_join flag is set true if the clause looks potentially useful as
 * a merge or hash join clause, that is if it is a binary opclause with
 * nonoverlapping sets of relids referenced in the left and right sides.
 * (Whether the operator is actually merge or hash joinable isn't checked,
 * however.)
 *
 * The pseudoconstant flag is set true if the clause contains no Vars of
 * the current query level and no volatile functions.  Such a clause can be
 * pulled out and used as a one-time qual in a gating Result node.	We keep
 * pseudoconstant clauses in the same lists as other RestrictInfos so that
 * the regular clause-pushing machinery can assign them to the correct join
 * level, but they need to be treated specially for cost and selectivity
 * estimates.  Note that a pseudoconstant clause can never be an indexqual
 * or merge or hash join clause, so it's of no interest to large parts of
 * the planner.
 *
 * When join clauses are generated from EquivalenceClasses, there may be
 * several equally valid ways to enforce join equivalence, of which we need
 * apply only one.	We mark clauses of this kind by setting parent_ec to
 * point to the generating EquivalenceClass.  Multiple clauses with the same
 * parent_ec in the same join are redundant.

 * and EXISTS(subselect) clauses create partial constraints on join order.

 * outer joins even if it appears in their RHS).  We don't bother to set
 * lhs_strict for FULL JOINs, however.
 *
 * It is not valid for either min_lefthand or min_righthand to be empty sets;
 * if they were, this would break the logic that enforces join order.
 *
 * syn_lefthand and syn_righthand are the sets of base relids that are

 * min_lefthand and min_righthand for higher joins.)
 *
 * delay_upper_joins is set TRUE if we detect a pushed-down clause that has
 * to be evaluated after this join is formed (because it references the RHS).
 * Any outer joins that have such a clause and this join in their RHS cannot
 * commute with this join, because that would leave noplace to check the
 * pushed-down clause.	(We don't track this for FULL JOINs, either.)
 *
 * join_quals is an implicit-AND list of the quals syntactically associated
 * with the join (they may or may not end up being applied at the join level).
 * This is just a side list and does not drive actual application of quals.
 * For JOIN_SEMI joins, this is cleared to NIL in create_unique_path() if

 *
 * For purposes of join selectivity estimation, we create transient
 * SpecialJoinInfo structures for regular inner joins; so it is possible
 * to have jointype == JOIN_INNER in such a structure, even though this is
 * not allowed within join_info_list.  We also create transient
 * SpecialJoinInfos with jointype == JOIN_INNER for outer joins, since for
 * cost estimation purposes it is sometimes useful to know the join size under
 * plain innerjoin semantics.  Note that lhs_strict, delay_upper_joins, and

 * Append-relation info.
 *
 * When we expand an inheritable table or a UNION-ALL subselect into an
 * "append relation" (essentially, a list of child RTEs), we build an
 * AppendRelInfo for each child RTE.  The list of AppendRelInfos indicates
 * which child RTEs must be included when expanding the parent, and each
 * node carries information needed to translate Vars referencing the parent
 * into Vars referencing that child.
 *
 * These structs are kept in the PlannerInfo node's append_rel_list.
 * Note that we just throw all the structs into one list, and scan the
 * whole list when desiring to expand any one parent.  We could have used
 * a more complex data structure (eg, one list per parent), but this would
 * be harder to update during operations such as pulling up subqueries,
 * and not really any easier to scan.  Considering that typical queries
 * will not have many different append parents, it doesn't seem worthwhile
 * to complicate things.
 *
 * Note: after completion of the planner prep phase, any given RTE is an
 * append parent having entries in append_rel_list if and only if its
 * "inh" flag is set.  We clear "inh" for plain tables that turn out not
 * to have inheritance children, and (in an abuse of the original meaning
 * of the flag) we set "inh" for subquery RTEs that turn out to be
 * flattenable UNION ALL queries.  This lets us avoid useless searches
 * of append_rel_list.
 *
 * Note: the data structure assumes that append-rel members are single
 * baserels.  This is OK for inheritance, but it prevents us from pulling
 * up a UNION ALL member subquery if it contains a join.  While that could
 * be fixed with a more complex data structure, at present there's not much
 * point because no improvement in the plan could result.

 * For each distinct placeholder expression generated during planning, we

 * PlaceHolderVar.	The phid fields identify which PlaceHolderInfo goes with
 * each PlaceHolderVar.  Note that phid is unique throughout a planner run,
 * not just within a query level --- this is so that we need not reassign ID's
 * when pulling a subquery into its parent.
 *
 * The idea is to evaluate the expression at (only) the ph_eval_at join level,
 * then allow it to bubble up like a Var until the ph_needed join level.
 * ph_needed has the same definition as attr_needed for a regular Var.
 *
 * ph_may_need is an initial estimate of ph_needed, formed using the
 * syntactic locations of references to the PHV.  We need this in order to
 * determine whether the PHV reference forces a join ordering constraint:
 * if the PHV has to be evaluated below the nullable side of an outer join,
 * and then used above that outer join, we must constrain join order to ensure
 * there's a valid place to evaluate the PHV below the join.  The final
 * actual ph_needed level might be lower than ph_may_need, but we can't
 * determine that until later on.  Fortunately this doesn't matter for what
 * we need ph_may_need for: if there's a PHV reference syntactically
 * above the outer join, it's not going to be allowed to drop below the outer
 * join, so we would come to the same conclusions about join order even if
 * we had the final ph_needed value to compare to.
 *
 * We create a PlaceHolderInfo only after determining that the PlaceHolderVar
 * is actually referenced in the plan tree, so that unreferenced placeholders
 * don't result in unnecessary constraints on join order.

 * At runtime, PARAM_EXEC slots are used to pass values around from one plan
 * node to another.  They can be used to pass values down into subqueries (for
 * outer references in subqueries), or up out of subqueries (for the results
 * of a subplan), or from a NestLoop plan node into its inner relation (when
 * the inner scan is parameterized with values from the outer relation).
 * The planner is responsible for assigning nonconflicting PARAM_EXEC IDs to
 * the PARAM_EXEC Params it generates.
 *
 * Outer references are managed via root->plan_params, which is a list of
 * PlannerParamItems.  While planning a subquery, each parent query level's
 * plan_params contains the values required from it by the current subquery.
 * During create_plan(), we use plan_params to track values that must be
 * passed from outer to inner sides of NestLoop plan nodes.
 *
 * The item a PlannerParamItem represents can be one of three kinds:
 *
 * A Var: the slot represents a variable of this level that must be passed
 * down because subqueries have outer references to it, or must be passed
 * from a NestLoop node to its inner scan.  The varlevelsup value in the Var
 * will always be zero.
 *
 * A PlaceHolderVar: this works much like the Var case, except that the
 * entry is a PlaceHolderVar node with a contained expression.  The PHV
 * will have phlevelsup = 0, and the contained expression is adjusted
 * to match in level.
 *
 * An Aggref (with an expression tree representing its argument): the slot
 * represents an aggregate expression that is an outer reference for some
 * subquery.  The Aggref itself has agglevelsup = 0, and its argument tree
 * is adjusted to match in level.
 *
 * Note: we detect duplicate Var and PlaceHolderVar parameters and coalesce
 * them into one slot, but we do not bother to do that for Aggrefs.
 * The scope of duplicate-elimination only extends across the set of
 * parameters passed from one query level into a single subquery, or for
 * nestloop parameters across the set of nestloop parameters used in a single
 * query level.  So there is no possibility of a PARAM_EXEC slot being used
 * for conflicting purposes.
 *
 * In addition, PARAM_EXEC slots are assigned for Params representing outputs
 * from subplans (values that are setParam items for those subplans).  These
 * IDs need not be tracked via PlannerParamItems, since we do not need any
 * duplicate-elimination nor later processing of the represented expressions.
 * Instead, we just record the assignment of the slot number by incrementing
 * root->glob->nParamExec.
