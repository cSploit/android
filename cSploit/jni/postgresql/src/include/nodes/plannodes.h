 * indexqualorig is an implicitly-ANDed list of index qual expressions, each

 * The indexkey is a Var or expression referencing column(s) of the index's
 * base table.	The comparisonval might be any expression, but it won't use
 * any columns of the base table.  The expressions are ordered by index
 * column position (but items referencing the same index column can appear
 * in any order).  indexqualorig is used at runtime only if we have to recheck
 * a lossy indexqual.
 *
 * indexqual has the same form, but the expressions have been commuted if
 * necessary to put the indexkeys on the left, and the indexkeys are replaced
 * by Var nodes identifying the index columns (varattno is the index column
 * position, not the base table's column, even though varno is for the base
 * table).	This is a bit hokey ... would be cleaner to use a special-purpose
 * node type that could not be mistaken for a regular Var.	But it will do
 * for now.
 *
 * indexorderbyorig is similarly the original form of any ORDER BY expressions
 * that are being implemented by the index, while indexorderby is modified to
 * have index column Vars on the left-hand side.  Here, multiple expressions
 * must appear in exactly the ORDER BY order, and this is not necessarily the
 * index column order.	Only the expressions are provided, not the auxiliary
 * sort-order information from the ORDER BY SortGroupClauses; it's assumed
 * that the sort ordering is fully determinable from the top-level operators.
 * indexorderbyorig is unused at run time, but is needed for EXPLAIN.

 * PlanRowMark -

 *
 * When doing UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE, we create a separate

 * are not specified as FOR UPDATE/SHARE are marked ROW_MARK_REFERENCE (if
 * real tables) or ROW_MARK_COPY (if not).
 *
 * Initially all PlanRowMarks have rti == prti and isParent == false.
 * When the planner discovers that a relation is the root of an inheritance
 * tree, it sets isParent true, and adds an additional PlanRowMark to the
 * list for each child relation (including the target rel itself in its role
 * as a child).  The child entries have rti == child rel's RT index and
 * prti == parent's RT index, and can therefore be recognized as children by
 * the fact that prti != rti.
 *
 * The planner also adds resjunk output columns to the plan that carry
 * information sufficient to identify the locked or fetched rows.  For
 * tables (markType != ROW_MARK_COPY), these columns are named
 *		tableoid%u			OID of table
 *		ctid%u				TID of row
 * The tableoid column is only present for an inheritance hierarchy.
 * When markType == ROW_MARK_COPY, there is instead a single column named
 *		wholerow%u			whole-row value of relation
 * In all three cases, %u represents the rowmark ID number (rowmarkId).
 * This number is unique within a plan tree, except that child relation
 * entries copy their parent's rowmarkId.  (Assigning unique numbers
 * means we needn't renumber rowmarkIds when flattening subqueries, which
 * would require finding and renaming the resjunk columns as well.)
 * Note this means that all tables in an inheritance hierarchy share the
 * same resjunk column names.  However, in an inherited UPDATE/DELETE the
 * columns could have different physical column numbers in each subplan.
