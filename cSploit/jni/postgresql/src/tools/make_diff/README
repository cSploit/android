scripts
=======

Here are some of the scripts I use to make development easier.

First, I use 'cporig' on every file I am about to change.  This makes a
copy with the extension .orig.  If an .orig already exists, I am warned.

I can get really fancy with this.  I can do 'cporig *' and make a .orig
for every file in the current directory.  I can:

	cporig `grep -l HeapTuple *`

If I use mkid (from ftp.postgreSQL.org), I can do:

	cporig `lid -kn 'fsyncOff'`

and get a copy of every file containing that word.  I can then do:

	vi `find . -name '*.orig'`

or even better (using mkid):

	eid fsyncOff

to edit all those files.

When I am ready to generate a patch, I run 'difforig' command from the top of
the source tree:

I pipe the output of this to a file to hold my patch, and the file names
it processes appear on my screen.  It creates a nice patch for me of all
the files I used with cporig.

Finally, I remove my old copies with 'rmorig'.
