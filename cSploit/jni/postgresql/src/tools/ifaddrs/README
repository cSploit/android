test_ifaddrs
============

This program prints the addresses and netmasks of all the IPv4 and IPv6
interfaces on the local machine.  It is useful for testing that this
functionality works on various platforms.  If "samehost" and "samenet"
in pg_hba.conf don't seem to work right, run this program to see what
is happening.

Usage:	test_ifaddrs
