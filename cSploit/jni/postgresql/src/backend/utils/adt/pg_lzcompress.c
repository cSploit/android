 * pg_lzcompress.c -
 *
 *		This is an implementation of LZ compression for PostgreSQL.
 *		It uses a simple history table and generates 2-3 byte tags
 *		capable of backward copy information for 3-273 bytes with
 *		a max offset of 4095.
 *
 *		Entry routines:
 *
 *			bool
 *			pglz_compress(const char *source, int32 slen, PGLZ_Header *dest,
 *						  const PGLZ_Strategy *strategy);
 *
 *				source is the input data to be compressed.
 *
 *				slen is the length of the input data.
 *
 *				dest is the output area for the compressed result.
 *					It must be at least as big as PGLZ_MAX_OUTPUT(slen).
 *
 *				strategy is a pointer to some information controlling
 *					the compression algorithm. If NULL, the compiled
 *					in default strategy is used.
 *
 *				The return value is TRUE if compression succeeded,
 *				FALSE if not; in the latter case the contents of dest
 *				are undefined.
 *
 *			void
 *			pglz_decompress(const PGLZ_Header *source, char *dest)
 *
 *				source is the compressed input.
 *
 *				dest is the area where the uncompressed data will be
 *					written to. It is the callers responsibility to
 *					provide enough space. The required amount can be
 *					obtained with the macro PGLZ_RAW_SIZE(source).
 *
 *					The data is written to buff exactly as it was handed
 *					to pglz_compress(). No terminating zero byte is added.
 *
 *		The decompression algorithm and internal data format:
 *
 *			PGLZ_Header is defined as
 *
 *				typedef struct PGLZ_Header {
 *					int32		vl_len_;
 *					int32		rawsize;
 *				}
 *
 *			The header is followed by the compressed data itself.
 *
 *			The data representation is easiest explained by describing
 *			the process of decompression.
 *
 *			If VARSIZE(x) == rawsize + sizeof(PGLZ_Header), then the data
 *			is stored uncompressed as plain bytes. Thus, the decompressor
 *			simply copies rawsize bytes from the location after the
 *			header to the destination.
 *
 *			Otherwise the first byte after the header tells what to do
 *			the next 8 times. We call this the control byte.
 *
 *			An unset bit in the control byte means, that one uncompressed
 *			byte follows, which is copied from input to output.
 *
 *			A set bit in the control byte means, that a tag of 2-3 bytes
 *			follows. A tag contains information to copy some bytes, that
 *			are already in the output buffer, to the current location in
 *			the output. Let's call the three tag bytes T1, T2 and T3. The
 *			position of the data to copy is coded as an offset from the
 *			actual output position.
 *
 *			The offset is in the upper nibble of T1 and in T2.
 *			The length is in the lower nibble of T1.
 *
 *			So the 16 bits of a 2 byte tag are coded as
 *
 *				7---T1--0  7---T2--0
 *				OOOO LLLL  OOOO OOOO
 *
 *			This limits the offset to 1-4095 (12 bits) and the length
 *			to 3-18 (4 bits) because 3 is always added to it. To emit
 *			a tag of 2 bytes with a length of 2 only saves one control
 *			bit. But we lose one byte in the possible length of a tag.
 *
 *			In the actual implementation, the 2 byte tag's length is
 *			limited to 3-17, because the value 0xF in the length nibble
 *			has special meaning. It means, that the next following
 *			byte (T3) has to be added to the length value of 18. That
 *			makes total limits of 1-4095 for offset and 3-273 for length.
 *
 *			Now that we have successfully decoded a tag. We simply copy
 *			the output that occurred <offset> bytes back to the current
 *			output location in the specified <length>. Thus, a
 *			sequence of 200 spaces (think about bpchar fields) could be
 *			coded in 4 bytes. One literal space and a three byte tag to
 *			copy 199 bytes with a -1 offset. Whow - that's a compression
 *			rate of 98%! Well, the implementation needs to save the
 *			original data size too, so we need another 4 bytes for it
 *			and end up with a total compression rate of 96%, what's still
 *			worth a Whow.
 *
 *		The compression algorithm
 *
 *			The following uses numbers used in the default strategy.
 *
 *			The compressor works best for attributes of a size between
 *			1K and 1M. For smaller items there's not that much chance of
 *			redundancy in the character sequence (except for large areas
 *			of identical bytes like trailing spaces) and for bigger ones
 *			our 4K maximum look-back distance is too small.
 *
 *			The compressor creates a table for 8192 lists of positions.
 *			For each input position (except the last 3), a hash key is
 *			built from the 4 next input bytes and the position remembered
 *			in the appropriate list. Thus, the table points to linked
 *			lists of likely to be at least in the first 4 characters
 *			matching strings. This is done on the fly while the input
 *			is compressed into the output area.  Table entries are only
 *			kept for the last 4096 input positions, since we cannot use
 *			back-pointers larger than that anyway.
 *
 *			For each byte in the input, it's hash key (built from this
 *			byte and the next 3) is used to find the appropriate list
 *			in the table. The lists remember the positions of all bytes
 *			that had the same hash key in the past in increasing backward
 *			offset order. Now for all entries in the used lists, the
 *			match length is computed by comparing the characters from the
 *			entries position with the characters from the actual input
 *			position.
 *
 *			The compressor starts with a so called "good_match" of 128.
 *			It is a "prefer speed against compression ratio" optimizer.
 *			So if the first entry looked at already has 128 or more
 *			matching characters, the lookup stops and that position is
 *			used for the next tag in the output.
 *
 *			For each subsequent entry in the history list, the "good_match"
 *			is lowered by 10%. So the compressor will be more happy with
 *			short matches the farer it has to go back in the history.
 *			Another "speed against ratio" preference characteristic of
 *			the algorithm.
 *
 *			Thus there are 3 stop conditions for the lookup of matches:
 *
 *				- a match >= good_match is found
 *				- there are no more history entries to look at
 *				- the next history entry is already too far back
 *				  to be coded into a tag.
 *
 *			Finally the match algorithm checks that at least a match
 *			of 3 or more bytes has been found, because thats the smallest
 *			amount of copy information to code into a tag. If so, a tag
 *			is omitted and all the input bytes covered by that are just
 *			scanned for the history add's, otherwise a literal character
 *			is omitted and only his history entry added.
