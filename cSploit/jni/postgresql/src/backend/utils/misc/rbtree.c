 * Red-black trees are a type of balanced binary tree wherein (1) any child of
 * a red node is always black, and (2) every path from root to leaf traverses
 * an equal number of black nodes.	From these properties, it follows that the
 * longest path from root to leaf is only about twice as long as the shortest,
 * so lookups are guaranteed to run in O(lg n) time.

 *	combiner: merge an existing tree entry with a new one
 *	allocfunc: allocate a new RBNode
 *	freefunc: free an old RBNode
 *	arg: passthrough pointer that will be passed to the manipulation functions
 *
 * Note that the combiner's righthand argument will be a "proposed" tree node,
 * ie the input to rb_insert, in which the RBNode fields themselves aren't
 * valid.  Similarly, either input to the comparator may be a "proposed" node.
 * This shouldn't matter since the functions aren't supposed to look at the
 * RBNode fields, only the extra fields of the struct the RBNode is embedded
 * in.
 *
 * The freefunc should just be pfree or equivalent; it should NOT attempt
 * to free any subsidiary data, because the node passed to it may not contain
 * valid data!	freefunc can be NULL if caller doesn't require retail
 * space reclamation.
 *
 * The RBTree node is palloc'd in the caller's memory context.	Note that
 * all contents of the tree are actually allocated by the caller, not here.
 *
 * Since tree contents are managed by the caller, there is currently not
 * an explicit "destroy" operation; typically a tree would be freed by
 * resetting or deleting the memory context it's stored in.  You can pfree
 * the RBTree node if you feel the urge.
