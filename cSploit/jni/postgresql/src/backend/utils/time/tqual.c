 *
 * tqual.c
 *	  POSTGRES "time qualification" code, ie, tuple visibility rules.
 *
 * NOTE: all the HeapTupleSatisfies routines will update the tuple's
 * "hint" status bits if we see that the inserting or deleting transaction
 * has now committed or aborted (and it is safe to set the hint bits).
 * If the hint bits are changed, SetBufferCommitInfoNeedsSave is called on
 * the passed-in buffer.  The caller must hold not only a pin, but at least
 * shared buffer content lock on the buffer containing the tuple.
 *
 * NOTE: must check TransactionIdIsInProgress (which looks in PGPROC array)
 * before TransactionIdDidCommit/TransactionIdDidAbort (which look in
 * pg_clog).  Otherwise we have a race condition: we might decide that a
 * just-committed transaction crashed, because none of the tests succeed.
 * xact.c is careful to record commit/abort in pg_clog before it unsets
 * MyProc->xid in PGPROC array.  That fixes that problem, but it also
 * means there is a window where TransactionIdIsInProgress and
 * TransactionIdDidCommit will both return true.  If we check only
 * TransactionIdDidCommit, we could consider a tuple committed when a
 * later GetSnapshotData call will still think the originating transaction
 * is in progress, which leads to application-level inconsistency.	The
 * upshot is that we gotta check TransactionIdIsInProgress first in all
 * code paths, except for a few cases where we are looking at
 * subtransactions of our own main transaction and so there can't be any
 * race condition.
 *
 * Summary of visibility functions:
 *
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesMVCC()
 *		  visible to supplied snapshot, excludes current command
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesNow()
 *		  visible to instant snapshot, excludes current command
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate()
 *		  like HeapTupleSatisfiesNow(), but with user-supplied command
 *		  counter and more complex result
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesSelf()
 *		  visible to instant snapshot and current command
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesDirty()
 *		  like HeapTupleSatisfiesSelf(), but includes open transactions
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum()
 *		  visible to any running transaction, used by VACUUM
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesToast()
 *		  visible unless part of interrupted vacuum, used for TOAST
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesAny()
 *		  all tuples are visible

 * SetHintBits()
 *
 * Set commit/abort hint bits on a tuple, if appropriate at this time.
 *
 * It is only safe to set a transaction-committed hint bit if we know the
 * transaction's commit record has been flushed to disk.  We cannot change
 * the LSN of the page here because we may hold only a share lock on the
 * buffer, so we can't use the LSN to interlock this; we have to just refrain
 * from setting the hint bit until some future re-examination of the tuple.
 *
 * We can always set hint bits when marking a transaction aborted.	(Some
 * code in heapam.c relies on that!)
 *
 * Also, if we are cleaning up HEAP_MOVED_IN or HEAP_MOVED_OFF entries, then
 * we can always set the hint bits, since pre-9.0 VACUUM FULL always used
 * synchronous commits and didn't move tuples that weren't previously
 * hinted.	(This is not known by this subroutine, but is applied by its
 * callers.)  Note: old-style VACUUM FULL is gone, but we have to keep this
 * module's support for MOVED_OFF/MOVED_IN flag bits for as long as we
 * support in-place update from pre-9.0 databases.
 *
 * Normal commits may be asynchronous, so for those we need to get the LSN
 * of the transaction and then check whether this is flushed.
 *
 * The caller should pass xid as the XID of the transaction to check, or
 * InvalidTransactionId if no check is needed.
