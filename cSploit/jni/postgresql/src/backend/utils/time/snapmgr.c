 * snapmgr.c
 *		PostgreSQL snapshot manager
 *
 * We keep track of snapshots in two ways: those "registered" by resowner.c,
 * and the "active snapshot" stack.  All snapshots in either of them live in
 * persistent memory.  When a snapshot is no longer in any of these lists
 * (tracked by separate refcounts on each snapshot), its memory can be freed.
 *
 * These arrangements let us reset MyProc->xmin when there are no snapshots
 * referenced by this transaction.	(One possible improvement would be to be
 * able to advance Xmin when the snapshot with the earliest Xmin is no longer
 * referenced.	That's a bit harder though, it requires more locking, and
 * anyway it should be rather uncommon to keep snapshots referenced for too
 * long.)
