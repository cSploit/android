 * logtape.c
 *	  Management of "logical tapes" within temporary files.
 *
 * This module exists to support sorting via multiple merge passes (see
 * tuplesort.c).  Merging is an ideal algorithm for tape devices, but if
 * we implement it on disk by creating a separate file for each "tape",
 * there is an annoying problem: the peak space usage is at least twice
 * the volume of actual data to be sorted.	(This must be so because each
 * datum will appear in both the input and output tapes of the final
 * merge pass.	For seven-tape polyphase merge, which is otherwise a
 * pretty good algorithm, peak usage is more like 4x actual data volume.)
 *
 * We can work around this problem by recognizing that any one tape
 * dataset (with the possible exception of the final output) is written
 * and read exactly once in a perfectly sequential manner.	Therefore,
 * a datum once read will not be required again, and we can recycle its
 * space for use by the new tape dataset(s) being generated.  In this way,
 * the total space usage is essentially just the actual data volume, plus
 * insignificant bookkeeping and start/stop overhead.
 *
 * Few OSes allow arbitrary parts of a file to be released back to the OS,
 * so we have to implement this space-recycling ourselves within a single
 * logical file.  logtape.c exists to perform this bookkeeping and provide
 * the illusion of N independent tape devices to tuplesort.c.  Note that
 * logtape.c itself depends on buffile.c to provide a "logical file" of
 * larger size than the underlying OS may support.
 *
 * For simplicity, we allocate and release space in the underlying file
 * in BLCKSZ-size blocks.  Space allocation boils down to keeping track
 * of which blocks in the underlying file belong to which logical tape,
 * plus any blocks that are free (recycled and not yet reused).
 * The blocks in each logical tape are remembered using a method borrowed
 * from the Unix HFS filesystem: we store data block numbers in an
 * "indirect block".  If an indirect block fills up, we write it out to
 * the underlying file and remember its location in a second-level indirect
 * block.  In the same way second-level blocks are remembered in third-
 * level blocks, and so on if necessary (of course we're talking huge
 * amounts of data here).  The topmost indirect block of a given logical
 * tape is never actually written out to the physical file, but all lower-
 * level indirect blocks will be.
 *
 * The initial write pass is guaranteed to fill the underlying file
 * perfectly sequentially, no matter how data is divided into logical tapes.
 * Once we begin merge passes, the access pattern becomes considerably
 * less predictable --- but the seeking involved should be comparable to
 * what would happen if we kept each logical tape in a separate file,
 * so there's no serious performance penalty paid to obtain the space
 * savings of recycling.  We try to localize the write accesses by always
 * writing to the lowest-numbered free block when we have a choice; it's
 * not clear this helps much, but it can't hurt.  (XXX perhaps a LIFO
 * policy for free blocks would be better?)
 *
 * To support the above policy of writing to the lowest free block,
 * ltsGetFreeBlock sorts the list of free block numbers into decreasing
 * order each time it is asked for a block and the list isn't currently
 * sorted.	This is an efficient way to handle it because we expect cycles
 * of releasing many blocks followed by re-using many blocks, due to
 * tuplesort.c's "preread" behavior.
 *
 * Since all the bookkeeping and buffer memory is allocated with palloc(),
 * and the underlying file(s) are made with OpenTemporaryFile, all resources
 * for a logical tape set are certain to be cleaned up even if processing
 * is aborted by ereport(ERROR).  To avoid confusion, the caller should take
 * care that all calls for a single LogicalTapeSet are made in the same
 * palloc context.
