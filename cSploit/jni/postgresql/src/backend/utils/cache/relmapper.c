 * relmapper.c
 *	  Catalog-to-filenode mapping
 *
 * For most tables, the physical file underlying the table is specified by
 * pg_class.relfilenode.  However, that obviously won't work for pg_class
 * itself, nor for the other "nailed" catalogs for which we have to be able
 * to set up working Relation entries without access to pg_class.  It also
 * does not work for shared catalogs, since there is no practical way to
 * update other databases' pg_class entries when relocating a shared catalog.
 * Therefore, for these special catalogs (henceforth referred to as "mapped
 * catalogs") we rely on a separately maintained file that shows the mapping
 * from catalog OIDs to filenode numbers.  Each database has a map file for
 * its local mapped catalogs, and there is a separate map file for shared
 * catalogs.  Mapped catalogs have zero in their pg_class.relfilenode entries.
 *
 * Relocation of a normal table is committed (ie, the new physical file becomes
 * authoritative) when the pg_class row update commits.  For mapped catalogs,
 * the act of updating the map file is effectively commit of the relocation.
 * We postpone the file update till just before commit of the transaction
 * doing the rewrite, but there is necessarily a window between.  Therefore
 * mapped catalogs can only be relocated by operations such as VACUUM FULL
 * and CLUSTER, which make no transactionally-significant changes: it must be
 * safe for the new file to replace the old, even if the transaction itself
 * aborts.	An important factor here is that the indexes and toast table of
 * a mapped catalog must also be mapped, so that the rewrites/relocations of
 * all these files commit in a single map file update rather than being tied
 * to transaction commit.
