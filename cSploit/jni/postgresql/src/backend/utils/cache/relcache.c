 * creation or deletion of an index.
 *
 * The returned list is guaranteed to be sorted in order by OID.  This is
 * needed by the executor, since for index types that we obtain exclusive
 * locks on when updating the index, all backends must lock the indexes in
 * the same order or we will get deadlocks (see ExecOpenIndices()).  Any
 * consistent ordering would do, but ordering by OID is easy.
 *
 * Since shared cache inval causes the relcache's copy of the list to go away,
 * we return a copy of the list palloc'd in the caller's context.  The caller
 * may list_free() the returned list after scanning it. This is necessary
 * since the caller will typically be doing syscache lookups on the relevant
 * indexes, and syscache lookup could cause SI messages to be processed!
 *
 * We also update rd_oidindex, which this module treats as effectively part
 * of the index list.  rd_oidindex is valid when rd_indexvalid isn't zero;
 * it is the pg_class OID of a unique index on OID when the relation has one,

/*
 *	load_relcache_init_file, write_relcache_init_file
 *
 *		In late 1992, we started regularly having databases with more than
 *		a thousand classes in them.  With this number of classes, it became
 *		critical to do indexed lookups on the system catalogs.
 *
 *		Bootstrapping these lookups is very hard.  We want to be able to
 *		use an index on pg_attribute, for example, but in order to do so,
 *		we must have read pg_attribute for the attributes in the index,
 *		which implies that we need to use the index.
 *
 *		In order to get around the problem, we do the following:
 *
 *		   +  When the database system is initialized (at initdb time), we
 *			  don't use indexes.  We do sequential scans.
 *
 *		   +  When the backend is started up in normal mode, we load an image
 *			  of the appropriate relation descriptors, in internal format,
 *			  from an initialization file in the data/base/... directory.
 *
 *		   +  If the initialization file isn't there, then we create the
 *			  relation descriptors using sequential scans and write 'em to
 *			  the initialization file for use by subsequent backends.
 *
 *		As of Postgres 9.0, there is one local initialization file in each
 *		database, plus one shared initialization file for shared catalogs.
 *
 *		We could dispense with the initialization files and just build the
 *		critical reldescs the hard way on every backend startup, but that
 *		slows down backend startup noticeably.
 *
 *		We can in fact go further, and save more relcache entries than
 *		just the ones that are absolutely critical; this allows us to speed
 *		up backend startup by not having to build such entries the hard way.
 *		Presently, all the catalog and index entries that are referred to
 *		by catcaches are stored in the initialization files.
 *
 *		The same mechanism that detects when catcache and relcache entries
 *		need to be invalidated (due to catalog updates) also arranges to
 *		unlink the initialization files when the contents may be out of date.
 *		The files will then be rebuilt during the next backend startup.
