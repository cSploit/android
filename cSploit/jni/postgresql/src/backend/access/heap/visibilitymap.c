 *		visibilitymap_clear - clear a bit in the visibility map
 *		visibilitymap_pin	- pin a map page for setting a bit
 *		visibilitymap_set	- set a bit in a previously pinned page
 *		visibilitymap_test	- test if a bit is set
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * The visibility map is a bitmap with one bit per heap page. A set bit means
 * that all tuples on the page are known visible to all transactions, and
 * therefore the page doesn't need to be vacuumed. The map is conservative in
 * the sense that we make sure that whenever a bit is set, we know the
 * condition is true, but if a bit is not set, it might or might not be true.
 *
 * There's no explicit WAL logging in the functions in this file. The callers
 * must make sure that whenever a bit is cleared, the bit is cleared on WAL
 * replay of the updating operation as well. Setting bits during recovery
 * isn't necessary for correctness.
 *
 * Currently, the visibility map is only used as a hint, to speed up VACUUM.
 * A corrupted visibility map won't cause data corruption, although it can
 * make VACUUM skip pages that need vacuuming, until the next anti-wraparound
 * vacuum. The visibility map is not used for anti-wraparound vacuums, because
 * an anti-wraparound vacuum needs to freeze tuples and observe the latest xid
 * present in the table, even on pages that don't have any dead tuples.
 *
 * Although the visibility map is just a hint at the moment, the PD_ALL_VISIBLE
 * flag on heap pages *must* be correct, because it is used to skip visibility
 * checking.
 *
 * LOCKING
 *
 * In heapam.c, whenever a page is modified so that not all tuples on the
 * page are visible to everyone anymore, the corresponding bit in the
 * visibility map is cleared. The bit in the visibility map is cleared
 * after releasing the lock on the heap page, to avoid holding the lock
 * over possible I/O to read in the visibility map page.
 *
 * To set a bit, you need to hold a lock on the heap page. That prevents
 * the race condition where VACUUM sees that all tuples on the page are
 * visible to everyone, but another backend modifies the page before VACUUM
 * sets the bit in the visibility map.
 *
 * When a bit is set, the LSN of the visibility map page is updated to make
 * sure that the visibility map update doesn't get written to disk before the
 * WAL record of the changes that made it possible to set the bit is flushed.
 * But when a bit is cleared, we don't have to do that because it's always
 * safe to clear a bit in the map from correctness point of view.
 *
 * TODO
 *
 * It would be nice to use the visibility map to skip visibility checks in
 * index scans.
 *
 * Currently, the visibility map is not 100% correct all the time.
 * During updates, the bit in the visibility map is cleared after releasing
 * the lock on the heap page. During the window between releasing the lock
 * and clearing the bit in the visibility map, the bit in the visibility map
 * is set, but the new insertion or deletion is not yet visible to other
 * backends.
 *
 * That might actually be OK for the index scans, though. The newly inserted
 * tuple wouldn't have an index pointer yet, so all tuples reachable from an
 * index would still be visible to all other backends, and deletions wouldn't
 * be visible to other backends yet.  (But HOT breaks that argument, no?)
 *
 * There's another hole in the way the PD_ALL_VISIBLE flag is set. When
 * vacuum observes that all tuples are visible to all, it sets the flag on
 * the heap page, and also sets the bit in the visibility map. If we then
 * crash, and only the visibility map page was flushed to disk, we'll have
 * a bit set in the visibility map, but the corresponding flag on the heap
 * page is not set. If the heap page is then updated, the updater won't
 * know to clear the bit in the visibility map.  (Isn't that prevented by
 * the LSN interlock?)
