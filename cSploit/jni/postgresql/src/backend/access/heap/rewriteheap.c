 *
 * rewriteheap.c
 *	  Support functions to rewrite tables.
 *
 * These functions provide a facility to completely rewrite a heap, while
 * preserving visibility information and update chains.
 *
 * INTERFACE
 *
 * The caller is responsible for creating the new heap, all catalog
 * changes, supplying the tuples to be written to the new heap, and
 * rebuilding indexes.	The caller must hold AccessExclusiveLock on the
 * target table, because we assume no one else is writing into it.
 *
 * To use the facility:
 *
 * begin_heap_rewrite
 * while (fetch next tuple)
 * {
 *	   if (tuple is dead)
 *		   rewrite_heap_dead_tuple
 *	   else
 *	   {
 *		   // do any transformations here if required
 *		   rewrite_heap_tuple
 *	   }
 * }
 * end_heap_rewrite
 *
 * The contents of the new relation shouldn't be relied on until after
 * end_heap_rewrite is called.
 *
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * This would be a fairly trivial affair, except that we need to maintain
 * the ctid chains that link versions of an updated tuple together.
 * Since the newly stored tuples will have tids different from the original
 * ones, if we just copied t_ctid fields to the new table the links would
 * be wrong.  When we are required to copy a (presumably recently-dead or
 * delete-in-progress) tuple whose ctid doesn't point to itself, we have
 * to substitute the correct ctid instead.
 *
 * For each ctid reference from A -> B, we might encounter either A first
 * or B first.	(Note that a tuple in the middle of a chain is both A and B
 * of different pairs.)
 *
 * If we encounter A first, we'll store the tuple in the unresolved_tups
 * hash table. When we later encounter B, we remove A from the hash table,
 * fix the ctid to point to the new location of B, and insert both A and B
 * to the new heap.
 *
 * If we encounter B first, we can insert B to the new heap right away.
 * We then add an entry to the old_new_tid_map hash table showing B's
 * original tid (in the old heap) and new tid (in the new heap).
 * When we later encounter A, we get the new location of B from the table,
 * and can write A immediately with the correct ctid.
 *
 * Entries in the hash tables can be removed as soon as the later tuple
 * is encountered.	That helps to keep the memory usage down.  At the end,
 * both tables are usually empty; we should have encountered both A and B
 * of each pair.  However, it's possible for A to be RECENTLY_DEAD and B
 * entirely DEAD according to HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum, because the test
 * for deadness using OldestXmin is not exact.	In such a case we might
 * encounter B first, and skip it, and find A later.  Then A would be added
 * to unresolved_tups, and stay there until end of the rewrite.  Since
 * this case is very unusual, we don't worry about the memory usage.
 *
 * Using in-memory hash tables means that we use some memory for each live
 * update chain in the table, from the time we find one end of the
 * reference until we find the other end.  That shouldn't be a problem in
 * practice, but if you do something like an UPDATE without a where-clause
 * on a large table, and then run CLUSTER in the same transaction, you
 * could run out of memory.  It doesn't seem worthwhile to add support for
 * spill-to-disk, as there shouldn't be that many RECENTLY_DEAD tuples in a
 * table under normal circumstances.  Furthermore, in the typical scenario
 * of CLUSTERing on an unchanging key column, we'll see all the versions
 * of a given tuple together anyway, and so the peak memory usage is only
 * proportional to the number of RECENTLY_DEAD versions of a single row, not
 * in the whole table.	Note that if we do fail halfway through a CLUSTER,
 * the old table is still valid, so failure is not catastrophic.
 *
 * We can't use the normal heap_insert function to insert into the new
 * heap, because heap_insert overwrites the visibility information.
 * We use a special-purpose raw_heap_insert function instead, which
 * is optimized for bulk inserting a lot of tuples, knowing that we have
 * exclusive access to the heap.  raw_heap_insert builds new pages in
 * local storage.  When a page is full, or at the end of the process,
 * we insert it to WAL as a single record and then write it to disk
 * directly through smgr.  Note, however, that any data sent to the new
 * heap's TOAST table will go through the normal bufmgr.
