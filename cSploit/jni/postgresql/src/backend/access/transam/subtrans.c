 * subtrans.c
 *		PostgreSQL subtransaction-log manager
 *
 * The pg_subtrans manager is a pg_clog-like manager that stores the parent
 * transaction Id for each transaction.  It is a fundamental part of the
 * nested transactions implementation.	A main transaction has a parent
 * of InvalidTransactionId, and each subtransaction has its immediate parent.
 * The tree can easily be walked from child to parent, but not in the
 * opposite direction.
 *
 * This code is based on clog.c, but the robustness requirements
 * are completely different from pg_clog, because we only need to remember
 * pg_subtrans information for currently-open transactions.  Thus, there is
 * no need to preserve data over a crash and restart.
 *
 * There are no XLOG interactions since we do not care about preserving
 * data across crashes.  During database startup, we simply force the
 * currently-active page of SUBTRANS to zeroes.
