/*----------
 * Shared-memory data structures for XLOG control
 *
 * LogwrtRqst indicates a byte position that we need to write and/or fsync
 * the log up to (all records before that point must be written or fsynced).
 * LogwrtResult indicates the byte positions we have already written/fsynced.
 * These structs are identical but are declared separately to indicate their
 * slightly different functions.
 *
 * We do a lot of pushups to minimize the amount of access to lockable
 * shared memory values.  There are actually three shared-memory copies of
 * LogwrtResult, plus one unshared copy in each backend.  Here's how it works:
 *		XLogCtl->LogwrtResult is protected by info_lck
 *		XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult is protected by WALWriteLock
 *		XLogCtl->Insert.LogwrtResult is protected by WALInsertLock
 * One must hold the associated lock to read or write any of these, but
 * of course no lock is needed to read/write the unshared LogwrtResult.
 *
 * XLogCtl->LogwrtResult and XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult are both "always
 * right", since both are updated by a write or flush operation before
 * it releases WALWriteLock.  The point of keeping XLogCtl->Write.LogwrtResult
 * is that it can be examined/modified by code that already holds WALWriteLock
 * without needing to grab info_lck as well.
 *
 * XLogCtl->Insert.LogwrtResult may lag behind the reality of the other two,
 * but is updated when convenient.	Again, it exists for the convenience of
 * code that is already holding WALInsertLock but not the other locks.
 *
 * The unshared LogwrtResult may lag behind any or all of these, and again
 * is updated when convenient.
 *
 * The request bookkeeping is simpler: there is a shared XLogCtl->LogwrtRqst
 * (protected by info_lck), but we don't need to cache any copies of it.
 *
 * Note that this all works because the request and result positions can only
 * advance forward, never back up, and so we can easily determine which of two
 * values is "more up to date".
 *
 * info_lck is only held long enough to read/update the protected variables,
 * so it's a plain spinlock.  The other locks are held longer (potentially
 * over I/O operations), so we use LWLocks for them.  These locks are:
 *
 * WALInsertLock: must be held to insert a record into the WAL buffers.
 *
 * WALWriteLock: must be held to write WAL buffers to disk (XLogWrite or
 * XLogFlush).
 *
 * ControlFileLock: must be held to read/update control file or create
 * new log file.
 *
 * CheckpointLock: must be held to do a checkpoint or restartpoint (ensures
 * only one checkpointer at a time; currently, with all checkpoints done by
 * the bgwriter, this is just pro forma).

 * Determine what log level should be used to report a corrupt WAL record

 * 'emode' is the error mode that would be used to report a file-not-found
 * or legitimate end-of-WAL situation.	 Generally, we use it as-is, but if
 * we're retrying the exact same record that we've tried previously, only
 * complain the first time to keep the noise down.	However, we only do when
 * reading from pg_xlog, because we don't expect any invalid records in archive
 * or in records streamed from master. Files in the archive should be complete,
 * and we should never hit the end of WAL because we stop and wait for more WAL
 * to arrive before replaying it.
 *
 * NOTE: This function remembers the RecPtr value it was last called with,
 * to suppress repeated messages about the same record. Only call this when
 * you are about to ereport(), or you might cause a later message to be
