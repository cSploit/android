/*
 *	_bt_preprocess_keys() -- Preprocess scan keys
 *
 * The caller-supplied search-type keys (in scan->keyData[]) are copied to
 * so->keyData[] with possible transformation.	scan->numberOfKeys is
 * the number of input keys, so->numberOfKeys gets the number of output
 * keys (possibly less, never greater).
 *
 * The output keys are marked with additional sk_flag bits beyond the
 * system-standard bits supplied by the caller.  The DESC and NULLS_FIRST
 * indoption bits for the relevant index attribute are copied into the flags.
 * Also, for a DESC column, we commute (flip) all the sk_strategy numbers
 * so that the index sorts in the desired direction.
 *
 * One key purpose of this routine is to discover how many scan keys
 * must be satisfied to continue the scan.	It also attempts to eliminate
 * redundant keys and detect contradictory keys.  (If the index opfamily
 * provides incomplete sets of cross-type operators, we may fail to detect
 * redundant or contradictory keys, but we can survive that.)
 *
 * The output keys must be sorted by index attribute.  Presently we expect
 * (but verify) that the input keys are already so sorted --- this is done
 * by group_clauses_by_indexkey() in indxpath.c.  Some reordering of the keys
 * within each attribute may be done as a byproduct of the processing here,
 * but no other code depends on that.
 *
 * The output keys are marked with flags SK_BT_REQFWD and/or SK_BT_REQBKWD
 * if they must be satisfied in order to continue the scan forward or backward
 * respectively.  _bt_checkkeys uses these flags.  For example, if the quals
 * are "x = 1 AND y < 4 AND z < 5", then _bt_checkkeys will reject a tuple
 * (1,2,7), but we must continue the scan in case there are tuples (1,3,z).
 * But once we reach tuples like (1,4,z) we can stop scanning because no
 * later tuples could match.  This is reflected by marking the x and y keys,
 * but not the z key, with SK_BT_REQFWD.  In general, the keys for leading
 * attributes with "=" keys are marked both SK_BT_REQFWD and SK_BT_REQBKWD.
 * For the first attribute without an "=" key, any "<" and "<=" keys are
 * marked SK_BT_REQFWD while any ">" and ">=" keys are marked SK_BT_REQBKWD.
 * This can be seen to be correct by considering the above example.  Note
 * in particular that if there are no keys for a given attribute, the keys for
 * subsequent attributes can never be required; for instance "WHERE y = 4"
 * requires a full-index scan.
 *
 * If possible, redundant keys are eliminated: we keep only the tightest
 * >/>= bound and the tightest </<= bound, and if there's an = key then
 * that's the only one returned.  (So, we return either a single = key,
 * or one or two boundary-condition keys for each attr.)  However, if we
 * cannot compare two keys for lack of a suitable cross-type operator,
 * we cannot eliminate either.	If there are two such keys of the same
 * operator strategy, the second one is just pushed into the output array
 * without further processing here.  We may also emit both >/>= or both
 * </<= keys if we can't compare them.  The logic about required keys still
 * works if we don't eliminate redundant keys.
 *
 * As a byproduct of this work, we can detect contradictory quals such
 * as "x = 1 AND x > 2".  If we see that, we return so->qual_ok = FALSE,
 * indicating the scan need not be run at all since no tuples can match.
 * (In this case we do not bother completing the output key array!)
 * Again, missing cross-type operators might cause us to fail to prove the
 * quals contradictory when they really are, but the scan will work correctly.
 *
 * Row comparison keys are currently also treated without any smarts:
 * we just transfer them into the preprocessed array without any
 * editorialization.  We can treat them the same as an ordinary inequality
 * comparison on the row's first index column, for the purposes of the logic
 * about required keys.
 *
 * Note: the reason we have to copy the preprocessed scan keys into private
 * storage is that we are modifying the array based on comparisons of the
 * key argument values, which could change on a rescan.  Therefore we can't
 * overwrite the caller's data structure.
