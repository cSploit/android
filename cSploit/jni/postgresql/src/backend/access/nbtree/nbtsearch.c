	 * thought of as the same as "> -infinity"), we can't use keys for any
	 * attributes to its right, because it would break our simplistic notion
	 * of what initial positioning strategy to use.
	 *
	 * When the scan keys include cross-type operators, _bt_preprocess_keys
	 * may not be able to eliminate redundant keys; in such cases we will
	 * arbitrarily pick a usable one for each attribute.  This is correct
	 * but possibly not optimal behavior.  (For example, with keys like
	 * "x >= 4 AND x >= 5" we would elect to scan starting at x=4 when
	 * x=5 would be more efficient.)  Since the situation only arises given
	 * a poorly-worded query plus an incomplete opfamily, live with it.

	 * When both equality and inequality keys appear for a single attribute
	 * (again, only possible when cross-type operators appear), we *must*
	 * select one of the equality keys for the starting point, because
	 * _bt_checkkeys() will stop the scan as soon as an equality qual fails.
	 * For example, if we have keys like "x >= 4 AND x = 10" and we elect to
	 * start at x=4, we will fail and stop before reaching x=10.  If multiple
	 * equality quals survive preprocessing, however, it doesn't matter which
	 * one we use --- by definition, they are either redundant or
	 * contradictory.
