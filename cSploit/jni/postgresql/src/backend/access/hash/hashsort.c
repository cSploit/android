 *
 * hashsort.c
 *		Sort tuples for insertion into a new hash index.
 *
 * When building a very large hash index, we pre-sort the tuples by bucket
 * number to improve locality of access to the index, and thereby avoid
 * thrashing.  We use tuplesort.c to sort the given index tuples into order.
 *
 * Note: if the number of rows in the table has been underestimated,
 * bucket splits may occur during the index build.	In that case we'd
 * be inserting into two or more buckets for each possible masked-off
 * hash code value.  That's no big problem though, since we'll still have
 * plenty of locality of access.
