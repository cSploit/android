 *	  These functions are stored in pg_amproc.	For each operator class
 *	  defined for hash indexes, they compute the hash value of the argument.
 *
 *	  Additional hash functions appear in /utils/adt/ files for various
 *	  specialized datatypes.
 *
 *	  It is expected that every bit of a hash function's 32-bit result is
 *	  as random as every other; failure to ensure this is likely to lead
 *	  to poor performance of hash joins, for example.  In most cases a hash
 *	  function should use hash_any() or its variant hash_uint32().

 * or Bob's article in Dr. Dobb's Journal, Sept. 1997.
 *
 * In the current code, we have adopted Bob's 2006 update of his hash
 * function to fetch the data a word at a time when it is suitably aligned.
 * This makes for a useful speedup, at the cost of having to maintain
 * four code paths (aligned vs unaligned, and little-endian vs big-endian).
 * It also uses two separate mixing functions mix() and final(), instead
 * of a slower multi-purpose function.

/*----------
 * mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.
 *
 * This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
 * still in (a,b,c) after mix().
 *
 * If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
 * mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
 * are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
 * This was tested for:
 * * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 *	 of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 *	 (a,b,c).
 * * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 *	 the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 *	 is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 *	 difference.
 * * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
 *	 all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.
 *
 * This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
 * that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
 * most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
 * avalanche in c.
 *
 * This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
 * the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
 * direction from the goal of parallelism.	I did what I could.  Rotates
 * seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands on,
 * and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used rotates.

 * final -- final mixing of 3 32-bit values (a,b,c) into c
