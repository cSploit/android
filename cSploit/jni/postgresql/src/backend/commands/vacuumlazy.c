 *
 * vacuumlazy.c
 *	  Concurrent ("lazy") vacuuming.
 *
 *
 * The major space usage for LAZY VACUUM is storage for the array of dead
 * tuple TIDs, with the next biggest need being storage for per-disk-page
 * free space info.  We want to ensure we can vacuum even the very largest
 * relations with finite memory space usage.  To do that, we set upper bounds
 * on the number of tuples and pages we will keep track of at once.
 *
 * We are willing to use at most maintenance_work_mem memory space to keep
 * track of dead tuples.  We initially allocate an array of TIDs of that size,
 * with an upper limit that depends on table size (this limit ensures we don't
 * allocate a huge area uselessly for vacuuming small tables).	If the array
 * threatens to overflow, we suspend the heap scan phase and perform a pass of
 * index cleanup and page compaction, then resume the heap scan with an empty
 * TID array.
 *
 * If we're processing a table with no indexes, we can just vacuum each page
 * as we go; there's no need to save up multiple tuples to minimize the number
 * of index scans performed.  So we don't use maintenance_work_mem memory for
 * the TID array, just enough to hold as many heap tuples as fit on one page.
