/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Async Notification Model as of 9.0:
 *
 * 1. Multiple backends on same machine. Multiple backends listening on
 *	  several channels. (Channels are also called "conditions" in other
 *	  parts of the code.)
 *
 * 2. There is one central queue in disk-based storage (directory pg_notify/),
 *	  with actively-used pages mapped into shared memory by the slru.c module.
 *	  All notification messages are placed in the queue and later read out
 *	  by listening backends.
 *
 *	  There is no central knowledge of which backend listens on which channel;
 *	  every backend has its own list of interesting channels.
 *
 *	  Although there is only one queue, notifications are treated as being
 *	  database-local; this is done by including the sender's database OID
 *	  in each notification message.  Listening backends ignore messages
 *	  that don't match their database OID.  This is important because it
 *	  ensures senders and receivers have the same database encoding and won't
 *	  misinterpret non-ASCII text in the channel name or payload string.
 *
 *	  Since notifications are not expected to survive database crashes,
 *	  we can simply clean out the pg_notify data at any reboot, and there
 *	  is no need for WAL support or fsync'ing.
 *
 * 3. Every backend that is listening on at least one channel registers by
 *	  entering its PID into the array in AsyncQueueControl. It then scans all
 *	  incoming notifications in the central queue and first compares the
 *	  database OID of the notification with its own database OID and then
 *	  compares the notified channel with the list of channels that it listens
 *	  to. In case there is a match it delivers the notification event to its
 *	  frontend.  Non-matching events are simply skipped.
 *
 * 4. The NOTIFY statement (routine Async_Notify) stores the notification in
 *	  a backend-local list which will not be processed until transaction end.
 *
 *	  Duplicate notifications from the same transaction are sent out as one
 *	  notification only. This is done to save work when for example a trigger
 *	  on a 2 million row table fires a notification for each row that has been
 *	  changed. If the application needs to receive every single notification
 *	  that has been sent, it can easily add some unique string into the extra
 *	  payload parameter.
 *
 *	  When the transaction is ready to commit, PreCommit_Notify() adds the
 *	  pending notifications to the head of the queue. The head pointer of the
 *	  queue always points to the next free position and a position is just a
 *	  page number and the offset in that page. This is done before marking the
 *	  transaction as committed in clog. If we run into problems writing the
 *	  notifications, we can still call elog(ERROR, ...) and the transaction
 *	  will roll back.
 *
 *	  Once we have put all of the notifications into the queue, we return to
 *	  CommitTransaction() which will then do the actual transaction commit.
 *
 *	  After commit we are called another time (AtCommit_Notify()). Here we
 *	  make the actual updates to the effective listen state (listenChannels).
 *
 *	  Finally, after we are out of the transaction altogether, we check if
 *	  we need to signal listening backends.  In SignalBackends() we scan the
 *	  list of listening backends and send a PROCSIG_NOTIFY_INTERRUPT signal
 *	  to every listening backend (we don't know which backend is listening on
 *	  which channel so we must signal them all). We can exclude backends that
 *	  are already up to date, though.  We don't bother with a self-signal
 *	  either, but just process the queue directly.
 *
 * 5. Upon receipt of a PROCSIG_NOTIFY_INTERRUPT signal, the signal handler
 *	  can call inbound-notify processing immediately if this backend is idle
 *	  (ie, it is waiting for a frontend command and is not within a transaction
 *	  block).  Otherwise the handler may only set a flag, which will cause the
 *	  processing to occur just before we next go idle.
 *
 *	  Inbound-notify processing consists of reading all of the notifications
 *	  that have arrived since scanning last time. We read every notification
 *	  until we reach either a notification from an uncommitted transaction or
 *	  the head pointer's position. Then we check if we were the laziest
 *	  backend: if our pointer is set to the same position as the global tail
 *	  pointer is set, then we move the global tail pointer ahead to where the
 *	  second-laziest backend is (in general, we take the MIN of the current
 *	  head position and all active backends' new tail pointers). Whenever we
 *	  move the global tail pointer we also truncate now-unused pages (i.e.,
 *	  delete files in pg_notify/ that are no longer used).
 *
 * An application that listens on the same channel it notifies will get
 * NOTIFY messages for its own NOTIFYs.  These can be ignored, if not useful,
 * by comparing be_pid in the NOTIFY message to the application's own backend's
 * PID.  (As of FE/BE protocol 2.0, the backend's PID is provided to the
 * frontend during startup.)  The above design guarantees that notifies from
 * other backends will never be missed by ignoring self-notifies.
 *
 * The amount of shared memory used for notify management (NUM_ASYNC_BUFFERS)
 * can be varied without affecting anything but performance.  The maximum
 * amount of notification data that can be queued at one time is determined
 * by slru.c's wraparound limit; see QUEUE_MAX_PAGE below.
