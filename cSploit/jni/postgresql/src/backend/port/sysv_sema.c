	 * try and lock the semaphore again.
	 *
	 * Each time around the loop, we check for a cancel/die interrupt.	On
	 * some platforms, if such an interrupt comes in while we are waiting, it
	 * will cause the semop() call to exit with errno == EINTR, allowing us to
	 * service the interrupt (if not in a critical section already) during the
	 * next loop iteration.
	 *
	 * Once we acquire the lock, we do NOT check for an interrupt before
	 * returning.  The caller needs to be able to record ownership of the lock
	 * before any interrupt can be accepted.
	 *
	 * There is a window of a few instructions between CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS
	 * and entering the semop() call.  If a cancel/die interrupt occurs in
	 * that window, we would fail to notice it until after we acquire the lock
	 * (or get another interrupt to escape the semop()).  We can avoid this
	 * problem by temporarily setting ImmediateInterruptOK to true before we
	 * do CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS; then, a die() interrupt in this interval will
	 * execute directly.  However, there is a huge pitfall: there is another
	 * window of a few instructions after the semop() before we are able to
	 * reset ImmediateInterruptOK.	If an interrupt occurs then, we'll lose
	 * control, which means that the lock has been acquired but our caller did
	 * not get a chance to record the fact. Therefore, we only set
	 * ImmediateInterruptOK if the caller tells us it's OK to do so, ie, the
	 * caller does not need to record acquiring the lock.  (This is currently
	 * true for lockmanager locks, since the process that granted us the lock
	 * did all the necessary state updates. It's not true for SysV semaphores
	 * used to implement LW locks or emulate spinlocks --- but the wait time
	 * for such locks should not be very long, anyway.)
	 *
	 * On some platforms, signals marked SA_RESTART (which is most, for us)
	 * will not interrupt the semop(); it will just keep waiting.  Therefore
	 * it's necessary for cancel/die interrupts to be serviced directly by the
	 * signal handler.	On these platforms the behavior is really the same
	 * whether the signal arrives just before the semop() begins, or while it
	 * is waiting.	The loop on EINTR is thus important only for other types
	 * of interrupts.
