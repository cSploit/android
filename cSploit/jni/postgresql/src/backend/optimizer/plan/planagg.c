 *
 * This module tries to replace MIN/MAX aggregate functions by subqueries
 * of the form
 *		(SELECT col FROM tab
 *		 WHERE col IS NOT NULL AND existing-quals
 *		 ORDER BY col ASC/DESC
 *		 LIMIT 1)
 * Given a suitable index on tab.col, this can be much faster than the
 * generic scan-all-the-rows aggregation plan.	We can handle multiple
 * MIN/MAX aggregates by generating multiple subqueries, and their
 * orderings can be different.	However, if the query contains any
 * non-optimizable aggregates, there's no point since we'll have to
 * scan all the rows anyway.
