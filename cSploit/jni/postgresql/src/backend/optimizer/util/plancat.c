 * build_physical_tlist
 *
 * Build a targetlist consisting of exactly the relation's user attributes,
 * in order.  The executor can special-case such tlists to avoid a projection
 * step at runtime, so we use such tlists preferentially for scan nodes.
 *
 * Exception: if there are any dropped columns, we punt and return NIL.
 * Ideally we would like to handle the dropped-column case too.  However this
 * creates problems for ExecTypeFromTL, which may be asked to build a tupdesc
 * for a tlist that includes vars of no-longer-existent types.	In theory we
 * could dig out the required info from the pg_attribute entries of the
 * relation, but that data is not readily available to ExecTypeFromTL.
 * For now, we don't apply the physical-tlist optimization when there are
 * dropped cols.
 *
 * We also support building a "physical" tlist for subqueries, functions,
 * values lists, and CTEs, since the same optimization can occur in
 * SubqueryScan, FunctionScan, ValuesScan, CteScan, and WorkTableScan nodes.
