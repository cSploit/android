/*----------
 * create_or_index_quals
 *	  Examine join OR-of-AND quals to see if any useful restriction OR
 *	  clauses can be extracted.  If so, add them to the query.
 *
 * Although a join clause must reference other relations overall,
 * an OR of ANDs clause might contain sub-clauses that reference just this
 * relation and can be used to build a restriction clause.
 * For example consider
 *		WHERE ((a.x = 42 AND b.y = 43) OR (a.x = 44 AND b.z = 45));
 * We can transform this into
 *		WHERE ((a.x = 42 AND b.y = 43) OR (a.x = 44 AND b.z = 45))
 *			AND (a.x = 42 OR a.x = 44)
 *			AND (b.y = 43 OR b.z = 45);
 * which opens the potential to build OR indexscans on a and b.  In essence
 * this is a partial transformation to CNF (AND of ORs format).  It is not
 * complete, however, because we do not unravel the original OR --- doing so
 * would usually bloat the qualification expression to little gain.
 *
 * The added quals are partially redundant with the original OR, and therefore
 * will cause the size of the joinrel to be underestimated when it is finally
 * formed.	(This would be true of a full transformation to CNF as well; the
 * fault is not really in the transformation, but in clauselist_selectivity's
 * inability to recognize redundant conditions.)  To minimize the collateral
 * damage, we want to minimize the number of quals added.  Therefore we do
 * not add every possible extracted restriction condition to the query.
 * Instead, we search for the single restriction condition that generates
 * the most useful (cheapest) OR indexscan, and add only that condition.
 * This is a pretty ad-hoc heuristic, but quite useful.
 *
 * We can then compensate for the redundancy of the added qual by poking
 * the recorded selectivity of the original OR clause, thereby ensuring
 * the added qual doesn't change the estimated size of the joinrel when
 * it is finally formed.  This is a MAJOR HACK: it depends on the fact
 * that clause selectivities are cached and on the fact that the same
 * RestrictInfo node will appear in every joininfo list that might be used
 * when the joinrel is formed.	And it probably isn't right in cases where
 * the size estimation is nonlinear (i.e., outer and IN joins).  But it
 * beats not doing anything.
 *
 * NOTE: one might think this messiness could be worked around by generating
 * the indexscan path with a small path->rows value, and not touching the
 * rel's baserestrictinfo or rel->rows.  However, that does not work.
 * The optimizer's fundamental design assumes that every general-purpose
 * Path for a given relation generates the same number of rows.  Without
 * this assumption we'd not be able to optimize solely on the cost of Paths,
 * but would have to take number of output rows into account as well.
 * (Perhaps someday that'd be worth doing, but it's a pretty big change...)
 *
 * 'rel' is the relation entry for which quals are to be created
 *
 * If successful, adds qual(s) to rel->baserestrictinfo and returns TRUE.
 * If no quals available, returns FALSE and doesn't change rel.
 *
 * Note: check_partial_indexes() must have been run previously.
