/*
 * process_equivalence
 *	  The given clause has a mergejoinable operator and can be applied without
 *	  any delay by an outer join, so its two sides can be considered equal
 *	  anywhere they are both computable; moreover that equality can be
 *	  extended transitively.  Record this knowledge in the EquivalenceClass
 *	  data structure.  Returns TRUE if successful, FALSE if not (in which
 *	  case caller should treat the clause as ordinary, not an equivalence).
 *
 * If below_outer_join is true, then the clause was found below the nullable
 * side of an outer join, so its sides might validly be both NULL rather than
 * strictly equal.	We can still deduce equalities in such cases, but we take
 * care to mark an EquivalenceClass if it came from any such clauses.  Also,
 * we have to check that both sides are either pseudo-constants or strict
 * functions of Vars, else they might not both go to NULL above the outer
 * join.  (This is the reason why we need a failure return.  It's more
 * convenient to check this case here than at the call sites...)
 *
 * On success return, we have also initialized the clause's left_ec/right_ec
 * fields to point to the EquivalenceClass representing it.  This saves lookup
 * effort later.
 *
 * Note: constructing merged EquivalenceClasses is a standard UNION-FIND
 * problem, for which there exist better data structures than simple lists.
 * If this code ever proves to be a bottleneck then it could be sped up ---
 * but for now, simple is beautiful.
 *
 * Note: this is only called during planner startup, not during GEQO
 * exploration, so we need not worry about whether we're in the right
 * memory context.

 * canonicalize_ec_expression

 *
 * The rule for datatypes is that the exposed type should match what it would
 * be for an input to an operator of the EC's opfamilies; which is usually
 * the declared input type of the operator, but in the case of polymorphic
 * operators no relabeling is wanted (compare the behavior of parse_coerce.c).
 * Expressions coming in from quals will generally have the right type
 * already, but expressions coming from indexkeys may not (because they are
 * represented without any explicit relabel in pg_index), and the same problem
 * occurs for sort expressions (because the parser is likewise cavalier about
 * putting relabels on them).  Such cases will be binary-compatible with the
 * real operators, so adding a RelabelType is sufficient.
 *
 * Also, the expression's exposed collation must match the EC's collation.
 * This is important because in comparisons like "foo < bar COLLATE baz",
 * only one of the expressions has the correct exposed collation as we receive
 * it from the parser.	Forcing both of them to have it ensures that all
 * variant spellings of such a construct behave the same.  Again, we can
 * stick on a RelabelType to force the right exposed collation.  (It might
 * work to not label the collation at all in EC members, but this is risky
 * since some parts of the system expect exprCollation() to deliver the

/*
 * generate_base_implied_equalities
 *	  Generate any restriction clauses that we can deduce from equivalence
 *	  classes.
 *
 * When an EC contains pseudoconstants, our strategy is to generate
 * "member = const1" clauses where const1 is the first constant member, for
 * every other member (including other constants).	If we are able to do this
 * then we don't need any "var = var" comparisons because we've successfully
 * constrained all the vars at their points of creation.  If we fail to
 * generate any of these clauses due to lack of cross-type operators, we fall
 * back to the "ec_broken" strategy described below.  (XXX if there are
 * multiple constants of different types, it's possible that we might succeed
 * in forming all the required clauses if we started from a different const
 * member; but this seems a sufficiently hokey corner case to not be worth
 * spending lots of cycles on.)
 *
 * For ECs that contain no pseudoconstants, we generate derived clauses
 * "member1 = member2" for each pair of members belonging to the same base
 * relation (actually, if there are more than two for the same base relation,
 * we only need enough clauses to link each to each other).  This provides
 * the base case for the recursion: each row emitted by a base relation scan
 * will constrain all computable members of the EC to be equal.  As each
 * join path is formed, we'll add additional derived clauses on-the-fly
 * to maintain this invariant (see generate_join_implied_equalities).
 *
 * If the opfamilies used by the EC do not provide complete sets of cross-type
 * equality operators, it is possible that we will fail to generate a clause
 * that must be generated to maintain the invariant.  (An example: given
 * "WHERE a.x = b.y AND b.y = a.z", the scheme breaks down if we cannot

/*
 * reconsider_outer_join_clauses
 *	  Re-examine any outer-join clauses that were set aside by
 *	  distribute_qual_to_rels(), and see if we can derive any
 *	  EquivalenceClasses from them.  Then, if they were not made
 *	  redundant, push them out into the regular join-clause lists.
 *
 * When we have mergejoinable clauses A = B that are outer-join clauses,
 * we can't blindly combine them with other clauses A = C to deduce B = C,
 * since in fact the "equality" A = B won't necessarily hold above the
 * outer join (one of the variables might be NULL instead).  Nonetheless
 * there are cases where we can add qual clauses using transitivity.
 *
 * One case that we look for here is an outer-join clause OUTERVAR = INNERVAR
 * for which there is also an equivalence clause OUTERVAR = CONSTANT.
 * It is safe and useful to push a clause INNERVAR = CONSTANT into the
 * evaluation of the inner (nullable) relation, because any inner rows not
 * meeting this condition will not contribute to the outer-join result anyway.
 * (Any outer rows they could join to will be eliminated by the pushed-down
 * equivalence clause.)
 *
 * Note that the above rule does not work for full outer joins; nor is it
 * very interesting to consider cases where the generated equivalence clause
 * would involve relations outside the outer join, since such clauses couldn't
 * be pushed into the inner side's scan anyway.  So the restriction to
 * outervar = pseudoconstant is not really giving up anything.
 *
 * For full-join cases, we can only do something useful if it's a FULL JOIN
 * USING and a merged column has an equivalence MERGEDVAR = CONSTANT.
 * By the time it gets here, the merged column will look like
 *		COALESCE(LEFTVAR, RIGHTVAR)
 * and we will have a full-join clause LEFTVAR = RIGHTVAR that we can match
 * the COALESCE expression to. In this situation we can push LEFTVAR = CONSTANT
 * and RIGHTVAR = CONSTANT into the input relations, since any rows not
 * meeting these conditions cannot contribute to the join result.
 *
 * Again, there isn't any traction to be gained by trying to deal with
 * clauses comparing a mergedvar to a non-pseudoconstant.  So we can make
 * use of the EquivalenceClasses to search for matching variables that were
 * equivalenced to constants.  The interesting outer-join clauses were
 * accumulated for us by distribute_qual_to_rels.
 *
 * When we find one of these cases, we implement the changes we want by
 * generating a new equivalence clause INNERVAR = CONSTANT (or LEFTVAR, etc)
 * and pushing it into the EquivalenceClass structures.  This is because we
 * may already know that INNERVAR is equivalenced to some other var(s), and
 * we'd like the constant to propagate to them too.  Note that it would be
 * unsafe to merge any existing EC for INNERVAR with the OUTERVAR's EC ---
 * that could result in propagating constant restrictions from
 * INNERVAR to OUTERVAR, which would be very wrong.
 *
 * It's possible that the INNERVAR is also an OUTERVAR for some other
 * outer-join clause, in which case the process can be repeated.  So we repeat
 * looping over the lists of clauses until no further deductions can be made.
 * Whenever we do make a deduction, we remove the generating clause from the
 * lists, since we don't want to make the same deduction twice.
 *
 * If we don't find any match for a set-aside outer join clause, we must
 * throw it back into the regular joinclause processing by passing it to
 * distribute_restrictinfo_to_rels().  If we do generate a derived clause,
 * however, the outer-join clause is redundant.  We still throw it back,
 * because otherwise the join will be seen as a clauseless join and avoided
 * during join order searching; but we mark it as redundant to keep from
 * messing up the joinrel's size estimate.  (This behavior means that the
 * API for this routine is uselessly complex: we could have just put all
 * the clauses into the regular processing initially.  We keep it because
 * someday we might want to do something else, such as inserting "dummy"
 * joinclauses instead of real ones.)
 *
 * Outer join clauses that are marked outerjoin_delayed are special: this
 * condition means that one or both VARs might go to null due to a lower
 * outer join.	We can still push a constant through the clause, but only
 * if its operator is strict; and we *have to* throw the clause back into
 * regular joinclause processing.  By keeping the strict join clause,
 * we ensure that any null-extended rows that are mistakenly generated due
 * to suppressing rows not matching the constant will be rejected at the
 * upper outer join.  (This doesn't work for full-join clauses.)
