/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * syncrep.c
 *
 * Synchronous replication is new as of PostgreSQL 9.1.
 *
 * If requested, transaction commits wait until their commit LSN is
 * acknowledged by the sync standby.
 *
 * This module contains the code for waiting and release of backends.
 * All code in this module executes on the primary. The core streaming
 * replication transport remains within WALreceiver/WALsender modules.
 *
 * The essence of this design is that it isolates all logic about
 * waiting/releasing onto the primary. The primary defines which standbys
 * it wishes to wait for. The standby is completely unaware of the
 * durability requirements of transactions on the primary, reducing the
 * complexity of the code and streamlining both standby operations and
 * network bandwidth because there is no requirement to ship
 * per-transaction state information.
 *
 * Replication is either synchronous or not synchronous (async). If it is
 * async, we just fastpath out of here. If it is sync, then in 9.1 we wait
 * for the flush location on the standby before releasing the waiting backend.
 * Further complexity in that interaction is expected in later releases.
 *
 * The best performing way to manage the waiting backends is to have a
 * single ordered queue of waiting backends, so that we can avoid
 * searching the through all waiters each time we receive a reply.
 *
 * In 9.1 we support only a single synchronous standby, chosen from a
 * priority list of synchronous_standby_names. Before it can become the
 * synchronous standby it must have caught up with the primary; that may
 * take some time. Once caught up, the current highest priority standby
 * will release waiters from the queue.
