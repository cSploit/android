 *
 * walreceiver.c
 *
 * The WAL receiver process (walreceiver) is new as of Postgres 9.0. It
 * is the process in the standby server that takes charge of receiving
 * XLOG records from a primary server during streaming replication.
 *
 * When the startup process determines that it's time to start streaming,
 * it instructs postmaster to start walreceiver. Walreceiver first connects
 * to the primary server (it will be served by a walsender process
 * in the primary server), and then keeps receiving XLOG records and
 * writing them to the disk as long as the connection is alive. As XLOG
 * records are received and flushed to disk, it updates the
 * WalRcv->receivedUpto variable in shared memory, to inform the startup
 * process of how far it can proceed with XLOG replay.
 *
 * Normal termination is by SIGTERM, which instructs the walreceiver to
 * exit(0). Emergency termination is by SIGQUIT; like any postmaster child
 * process, the walreceiver will simply abort and exit on SIGQUIT. A close
 * of the connection and a FATAL error are treated not as a crash but as
 * normal operation.
 *
 * This file contains the server-facing parts of walreceiver. The libpq-
 * specific parts are in the libpqwalreceiver module. It's loaded
 * dynamically to avoid linking the server with libpq.
