/*
 * The postmaster is signaled by its children by sending SIGUSR1.  The
 * specific reason is communicated via flags in shared memory.	We keep
 * a boolean flag for each possible "reason", so that different reasons
 * can be signaled by different backends at the same time.	(However,
 * if the same reason is signaled more than once simultaneously, the
 * postmaster will observe it only once.)
 *
 * The flags are actually declared as "volatile sig_atomic_t" for maximum
 * portability.  This should ensure that loads and stores of the flag
 * values are atomic, allowing us to dispense with any explicit locking.
 *
 * In addition to the per-reason flags, we store a set of per-child-process
 * flags that are currently used only for detecting whether a backend has
 * exited without performing proper shutdown.  The per-child-process flags
 * have three possible states: UNUSED, ASSIGNED, ACTIVE.  An UNUSED slot is
 * available for assignment.  An ASSIGNED slot is associated with a postmaster
 * child process, but either the process has not touched shared memory yet,
 * or it has successfully cleaned up after itself.	A ACTIVE slot means the
 * process is actively using shared memory.  The slots are assigned to
 * child processes at random, and postmaster.c is responsible for tracking
 * which one goes with which PID.
 *
 * Actually there is a fourth state, WALSENDER.  This is just like ACTIVE,
 * but carries the extra information that the child is a WAL sender.
 * WAL senders too start in ACTIVE state, but switch to WALSENDER once they
 * start streaming the WAL (and they never go back to ACTIVE after that).
