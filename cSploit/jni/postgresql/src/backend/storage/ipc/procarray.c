 *
 * procarray.c
 *	  POSTGRES process array code.
 *
 *
 * This module maintains an unsorted array of the PGPROC structures for all
 * active backends.  Although there are several uses for this, the principal
 * one is as a means of determining the set of currently running transactions.
 *
 * Because of various subtle race conditions it is critical that a backend
 * hold the correct locks while setting or clearing its MyProc->xid field.
 * See notes in src/backend/access/transam/README.
 *
 * The process array now also includes PGPROC structures representing
 * prepared transactions.  The xid and subxids fields of these are valid,
 * as are the myProcLocks lists.  They can be distinguished from regular
 * backend PGPROCs at need by checking for pid == 0.
 *
 * During hot standby, we also keep a list of XIDs representing transactions
 * that are known to be running in the master (or more precisely, were running
 * as of the current point in the WAL stream).	This list is kept in the
 * KnownAssignedXids array, and is updated by watching the sequence of
 * arriving XIDs.  This is necessary because if we leave those XIDs out of
 * snapshots taken for standby queries, then they will appear to be already
 * complete, leading to MVCC failures.	Note that in hot standby, the PGPROC
 * array represents standby processes, which by definition are not running
 * transactions that have XIDs.
 *
 * It is perhaps possible for a backend on the master to terminate without
 * writing an abort record for its transaction.  While that shouldn't really
 * happen, it would tie up KnownAssignedXids indefinitely, so we protect
 * ourselves by pruning the array when a valid list of running XIDs arrives.

 * Aside from some shortcuts such as checking RecentXmin and our own Xid,
 * there are four possibilities for finding a running transaction:
 *
 * 1. The given Xid is a main transaction Id.  We will find this out cheaply
 * by looking at the PGPROC struct for each backend.
 *
 * 2. The given Xid is one of the cached subxact Xids in the PGPROC array.
 * We can find this out cheaply too.
 *
 * 3. In Hot Standby mode, we must search the KnownAssignedXids list to see
 * if the Xid is running on the master.
 *
 * 4. Search the SubTrans tree to find the Xid's topmost parent, and then
 * see if that is running according to PGPROC or KnownAssignedXids.  This is
 * the slowest way, but sadly it has to be done always if the others failed,
 * unless we see that the cached subxact sets are complete (none have
 * overflowed).
 *
 * ProcArrayLock has to be held while we do 1, 2, 3.  If we save the top Xids
 * while doing 1 and 3, we can release the ProcArrayLock while we do 4.
 * This buys back some concurrency (and we can't retrieve the main Xids from
 * PGPROC again anyway; see GetNewTransactionId).

 *
 * This is used by VACUUM to decide which deleted tuples must be preserved

 * FALSE is sufficient for non-shared relations, since only backends in my
 * own database could ever see the tuples in them.	Also, we can ignore
 * concurrently running lazy VACUUMs because (a) they must be working on other
 * tables, and (b) they don't need to do snapshot-based lookups.
 *
 * This is also used to determine where to truncate pg_subtrans.  allDbs
 * must be TRUE for that case, and ignoreVacuum FALSE.
 *
 * Note: we include all currently running xids in the set of considered xids.
 * This ensures that if a just-started xact has not yet set its snapshot,
 * when it does set the snapshot it cannot set xmin less than what we compute.
 * See notes in src/backend/access/transam/README.
 *
 * Note: despite the above, it's possible for the calculated value to move
 * backwards on repeated calls. The calculated value is conservative, so that
 * anything older is definitely not considered as running by anyone anymore,
 * but the exact value calculated depends on a number of things. For example,
 * if allDbs is FALSE and there are no transactions running in the current
 * database, GetOldestXmin() returns latestCompletedXid. If a transaction
 * begins after that, its xmin will include in-progress transactions in other
 * databases that started earlier, so another call will return a lower value.
 * Nonetheless it is safe to vacuum a table in the current database with the
 * first result.  There are also replication-related effects: a walsender
 * process can set its xmin based on transactions that are no longer running
 * in the master but are still being replayed on the standby, thus possibly
 * making the GetOldestXmin reading go backwards.  In this case there is a
 * possibility that we lose data that the standby would like to have, but
 * there is little we can do about that --- data is only protected if the
 * walsender runs continuously while queries are executed on the standby.
 * (The Hot Standby code deals with such cases by failing standby queries
 * that needed to access already-removed data, so there's no integrity bug.)
 * The return value is also adjusted with vacuum_defer_cleanup_age, so
 * increasing that setting on the fly is another easy way to make
 * GetOldestXmin() move backwards, with no consequences for data integrity.

/*
 * In Hot Standby mode, we maintain a list of transactions that are (or were)
 * running in the master at the current point in WAL.  These XIDs must be
 * treated as running by standby transactions, even though they are not in
 * the standby server's PGPROC array.
 *
 * We record all XIDs that we know have been assigned.	That includes all the
 * XIDs seen in WAL records, plus all unobserved XIDs that we can deduce have
 * been assigned.  We can deduce the existence of unobserved XIDs because we
 * know XIDs are assigned in sequence, with no gaps.  The KnownAssignedXids
 * list expands as new XIDs are observed or inferred, and contracts when
 * transaction completion records arrive.
 *
 * During hot standby we do not fret too much about the distinction between
 * top-level XIDs and subtransaction XIDs. We store both together in the
 * KnownAssignedXids list.	In backends, this is copied into snapshots in
 * GetSnapshotData(), taking advantage of the fact that XidInMVCCSnapshot()
 * doesn't care about the distinction either.  Subtransaction XIDs are
 * effectively treated as top-level XIDs and in the typical case pg_subtrans
 * links are *not* maintained (which does not affect visibility).
 *
 * We have room in KnownAssignedXids and in snapshots to hold maxProcs *
 * (1 + PGPROC_MAX_CACHED_SUBXIDS) XIDs, so every master transaction must
 * report its subtransaction XIDs in a WAL XLOG_XACT_ASSIGNMENT record at
 * least every PGPROC_MAX_CACHED_SUBXIDS.  When we receive one of these
 * records, we mark the subXIDs as children of the top XID in pg_subtrans,
 * and then remove them from KnownAssignedXids.  This prevents overflow of
 * KnownAssignedXids and snapshots, at the cost that status checks for these
 * subXIDs will take a slower path through TransactionIdIsInProgress().
 * This means that KnownAssignedXids is not necessarily complete for subXIDs,
 * though it should be complete for top-level XIDs; this is the same situation
 * that holds with respect to the PGPROC entries in normal running.
 *
 * When we throw away subXIDs from KnownAssignedXids, we need to keep track of
 * that, similarly to tracking overflow of a PGPROC's subxids array.  We do
 * that by remembering the lastOverflowedXID, ie the last thrown-away subXID.
 * As long as that is within the range of interesting XIDs, we have to assume
 * that subXIDs are missing from snapshots.  (Note that subXID overflow occurs
 * on primary when 65th subXID arrives, whereas on standby it occurs when 64th
 * subXID arrives - that is not an error.)
 *
 * Should a backend on primary somehow disappear before it can write an abort
 * record, then we just leave those XIDs in KnownAssignedXids. They actually
 * aborted but we think they were running; the distinction is irrelevant
 * because either way any changes done by the transaction are not visible to
 * backends in the standby.  We prune KnownAssignedXids when
 * XLOG_RUNNING_XACTS arrives, to forestall possible overflow of the
 * array due to such dead XIDs.

/*
 * Private module functions to manipulate KnownAssignedXids
 *
 * There are 5 main uses of the KnownAssignedXids data structure:
 *
 *	* backends taking snapshots - all valid XIDs need to be copied out
 *	* backends seeking to determine presence of a specific XID
 *	* startup process adding new known-assigned XIDs
 *	* startup process removing specific XIDs as transactions end
 *	* startup process pruning array when special WAL records arrive
 *
 * This data structure is known to be a hot spot during Hot Standby, so we
 * go to some lengths to make these operations as efficient and as concurrent
 * as possible.
 *
 * The XIDs are stored in an array in sorted order --- TransactionIdPrecedes
 * order, to be exact --- to allow binary search for specific XIDs.  Note:
 * in general TransactionIdPrecedes would not provide a total order, but
 * we know that the entries present at any instant should not extend across
 * a large enough fraction of XID space to wrap around (the master would
 * shut down for fear of XID wrap long before that happens).  So it's OK to
 * use TransactionIdPrecedes as a binary-search comparator.
 *
 * It's cheap to maintain the sortedness during insertions, since new known
 * XIDs are always reported in XID order; we just append them at the right.
 *
 * To keep individual deletions cheap, we need to allow gaps in the array.
 * This is implemented by marking array elements as valid or invalid using
 * the parallel boolean array KnownAssignedXidsValid[].  A deletion is done
 * by setting KnownAssignedXidsValid[i] to false, *without* clearing the
 * XID entry itself.  This preserves the property that the XID entries are
 * sorted, so we can do binary searches easily.  Periodically we compress
 * out the unused entries; that's much cheaper than having to compress the
 * array immediately on every deletion.
 *
 * The actually valid items in KnownAssignedXids[] and KnownAssignedXidsValid[]
 * are those with indexes tail <= i < head; items outside this subscript range
 * have unspecified contents.  When head reaches the end of the array, we
 * force compression of unused entries rather than wrapping around, since
 * allowing wraparound would greatly complicate the search logic.  We maintain
 * an explicit tail pointer so that pruning of old XIDs can be done without
 * immediately moving the array contents.  In most cases only a small fraction
 * of the array contains valid entries at any instant.
 *
 * Although only the startup process can ever change the KnownAssignedXids
 * data structure, we still need interlocking so that standby backends will
 * not observe invalid intermediate states.  The convention is that backends
 * must hold shared ProcArrayLock to examine the array.  To remove XIDs from
 * the array, the startup process must hold ProcArrayLock exclusively, for
 * the usual transactional reasons (compare commit/abort of a transaction
 * during normal running).	Compressing unused entries out of the array
 * likewise requires exclusive lock.  To add XIDs to the array, we just insert
 * them into slots to the right of the head pointer and then advance the head
 * pointer.  This wouldn't require any lock at all, except that on machines
 * with weak memory ordering we need to be careful that other processors
 * see the array element changes before they see the head pointer change.
 * We handle this by using a spinlock to protect reads and writes of the
 * head/tail pointers.	(We could dispense with the spinlock if we were to
 * create suitable memory access barrier primitives and use those instead.)
 * The spinlock must be taken to read or write the head/tail pointers unless
 * the caller holds ProcArrayLock exclusively.
 *
 * Algorithmic analysis:
 *
 * If we have a maximum of M slots, with N XIDs currently spread across
 * S elements then we have N <= S <= M always.
 *
 *	* Adding a new XID is O(1) and needs little locking (unless compression
 *		must happen)
 *	* Compressing the array is O(S) and requires exclusive lock
 *	* Removing an XID is O(logS) and requires exclusive lock
 *	* Taking a snapshot is O(S) and requires shared lock
 *	* Checking for an XID is O(logS) and requires shared lock
 *
 * In comparison, using a hash table for KnownAssignedXids would mean that
 * taking snapshots would be O(M). If we can maintain S << M then the
 * sorted array technique will deliver significantly faster snapshots.
 * If we try to keep S too small then we will spend too much time compressing,
 * so there is an optimal point for any workload mix. We use a heuristic to
 * decide when to compress the array, though trimming also helps reduce
 * frequency of compressing. The heuristic requires us to track the number of
 * currently valid XIDs in the array.
