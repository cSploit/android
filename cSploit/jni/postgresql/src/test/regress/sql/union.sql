-- Subqueries with ORDER BY & LIMIT clauses
--

-- In this syntax, ORDER BY/LIMIT apply to the result of the EXCEPT
SELECT q1,q2 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q2,q1 FROM int8_tbl
ORDER BY q2,q1;

-- This should fail, because q2 isn't a name of an EXCEPT output column
SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY q2 LIMIT 1;

-- But this should work:
SELECT q1 FROM int8_tbl EXCEPT (((SELECT q2 FROM int8_tbl ORDER BY q2 LIMIT 1)));

--
-- New syntaxes (7.1) permit new tests
--

(((((select * from int8_tbl)))));

--
-- Check handling of a case with unknown constants.  We don't guarantee
-- an undecorated constant will work in all cases, but historically this
-- usage has worked, so test we don't break it.
