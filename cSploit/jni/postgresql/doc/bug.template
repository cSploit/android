If PostgreSQL failed to compile on your computer or you found a bug,
please fill out this form and e-mail it to pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org.

If your bug report has security implications and you'd prefer that it not
become immediately visible in public archives, don't send it to pgsql-bugs.
Security issues can be reported privately to security@postgresql.org.

If you not only found the problem but solved it and generated a patch
then e-mail it to pgsql-hackers@postgresql.org instead.  Please use the
command "diff -c" to generate the patch.

You may also enter a bug report at http://www.postgresql.org/ instead of
e-mailing this form.
