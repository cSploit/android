% This file redefines FlowObjectSetup to eliminate one of the two control
% sequences it normally creates, thereby substantially reducing string usage
% and permitting the complete Postgres documentation to be built without
% overflowing a hard-to-expand TeX limit.  The only known penalty is an
% increased number of TeX warnings about ignoring duplicate definitions.
%
% Curiously, we only see the failure when building PDF output --- plain PS
% output does not come anywhere close to overflowing the string table.
% There may be another solution hidden in that observation.
