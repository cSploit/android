 <para>
  Database servers can work together to allow a second server to
  take over quickly if the primary server fails (high
  availability), or to allow several computers to serve the same
  data (load balancing).  Ideally, database servers could work
  together seamlessly.  Web servers serving static web pages can
  be combined quite easily by merely load-balancing web requests
  to multiple machines.  In fact, read-only database servers can
  be combined relatively easily too.  Unfortunately, most database
  servers have a read/write mix of requests, and read/write servers
  are much harder to combine.  This is because though read-only
  data needs to be placed on each server only once, a write to any
  server has to be propagated to all servers so that future read
  requests to those servers return consistent results.
 </para>

 <para>
  This synchronization problem is the fundamental difficulty for
  servers working together.  Because there is no single solution
  that eliminates the impact of the sync problem for all use cases,
  there are multiple solutions.  Each solution addresses this
  problem in a different way, and minimizes its impact for a specific
  workload.
 </para>

 <para>
  Some solutions deal with synchronization by allowing only one
  server to modify the data.  Servers that can modify data are
  called read/write, <firstterm>master</> or <firstterm>primary</> servers.
  Servers that track changes in the master are called <firstterm>standby</>
  or <firstterm>slave</> servers. A standby server that cannot be connected
  to until it is promoted to a master server is called a <firstterm>warm
  standby</> server, and one that can accept connections and serves read-only
  queries is called a <firstterm>hot standby</> server.
 </para>

 <para>
  Some solutions are synchronous,
  meaning that a data-modifying transaction is not considered
  committed until all servers have committed the transaction.  This
  guarantees that a failover will not lose any data and that all
  load-balanced servers will return consistent results no matter
  which server is queried. In contrast, asynchronous solutions allow some
  delay between the time of a commit and its propagation to the other servers,
  opening the possibility that some transactions might be lost in
  the switch to a backup server, and that load balanced servers
  might return slightly stale results.  Asynchronous communication
  is used when synchronous would be too slow.
 </para>

 <para>
  Solutions can also be categorized by their granularity.  Some solutions
  can deal only with an entire database server, while others allow control
  at the per-table or per-database level.
 </para>

 <para>
  Performance must be considered in any choice.  There is usually a
  trade-off between functionality and
  performance.  For example, a fully synchronous solution over a slow
  network might cut performance by more than half, while an asynchronous
  one might have a minimal performance impact.

  and load balancing solutions.  A <ulink

   <term>Shared Disk Failover</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     Shared disk failover avoids synchronization overhead by having only one
     copy of the database.  It uses a single disk array that is shared by
     multiple servers.  If the main database server fails, the standby server
     is able to mount and start the database as though it were recovering from
     a database crash.  This allows rapid failover with no data loss.
    </para>

    <para>
     Shared hardware functionality is common in network storage devices.
     Using a network file system is also possible, though care must be
     taken that the file system has full <acronym>POSIX</> behavior (see <xref
     linkend="creating-cluster-nfs">).  One significant limitation of this
     method is that if the shared disk array fails or becomes corrupt, the
     primary and standby servers are both nonfunctional.  Another issue is
     that the standby server should never access the shared storage while
     the primary server is running.

   <term>File System (Block-Device) Replication</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     A modified version of shared hardware functionality is file system
     replication, where all changes to a file system are mirrored to a file
     system residing on another computer.  The only restriction is that
     the mirroring must be done in a way that ensures the standby server
     has a consistent copy of the file system &mdash; specifically, writes
     to the standby must be done in the same order as those on the master.
     <productname>DRBD</> is a popular file system replication solution
     for Linux.

Oracle RAC is a shared disk approach and just send cache invalidations
to other nodes but not actual data. As the disk is shared, data is
only committed once to disk and there is a distributed locking
protocol to make nodes agree on a serializable transactional order.

   <term>Warm and Hot Standby Using Point-In-Time Recovery (<acronym>PITR</>)</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     Warm and hot standby servers can be kept current by reading a
     stream of write-ahead log (<acronym>WAL</>)
     records.  If the main server fails, the standby contains
     almost all of the data of the main server, and can be quickly
     made the new master database server.  This is asynchronous and
     can only be done for the entire database server.
    </para>
    <para>
     A PITR standby server can be implemented using file-based log shipping
     (<xref linkend="warm-standby">) or streaming replication (see
     <xref linkend="streaming-replication">), or a combination of both. For
     information on hot standby, see <xref linkend="hot-standby">.

   <term>Trigger-Based Master-Standby Replication</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     A master-standby replication setup sends all data modification
     queries to the master server.  The master server asynchronously
     sends data changes to the standby server.  The standby can answer
     read-only queries while the master server is running.  The
     standby server is ideal for data warehouse queries.
    </para>

    <para>
     <productname>Slony-I</> is an example of this type of replication, with per-table
     granularity, and support for multiple standby servers.  Because it
     updates the standby server asynchronously (in batches), there is
     possible data loss during fail over.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Statement-Based Replication Middleware</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     With statement-based replication middleware, a program intercepts
     every SQL query and sends it to one or all servers.  Each server
     operates independently.  Read-write queries must be sent to all servers,
     so that every server receives any changes.  But read-only queries can be
     sent to just one server, allowing the read workload to be distributed
     among them.
    </para>

    <para>
     If queries are simply broadcast unmodified, functions like
     <function>random()</>, <function>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</>, and
     sequences can have different values on different servers.
     This is because each server operates independently, and because
     SQL queries are broadcast (and not actual modified rows).  If
     this is unacceptable, either the middleware or the application
     must query such values from a single server and then use those
     values in write queries.  Another option is to use this replication
     option with a traditional master-standby setup, i.e. data modification
     queries are sent only to the master and are propagated to the
     standby servers via master-standby replication, not by the replication
     middleware.  Care must also be taken that all
     transactions either commit or abort on all servers, perhaps
     using two-phase commit (<xref linkend="sql-prepare-transaction">
     and <xref linkend="sql-commit-prepared">.
     <productname>Pgpool-II</> and <productname>Continuent Tungsten</>
     are examples of this type of replication.

   <term>Asynchronous Multimaster Replication</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     For servers that are not regularly connected, like laptops or
     remote servers, keeping data consistent among servers is a
     challenge.  Using asynchronous multimaster replication, each
     server works independently, and periodically communicates with
     the other servers to identify conflicting transactions.  The
     conflicts can be resolved by users or conflict resolution rules.
     Bucardo is an example of this type of replication.

  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Synchronous Multimaster Replication</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     In synchronous multimaster replication, each server can accept
     write requests, and modified data is transmitted from the
     original server to every other server before each transaction
     commits.  Heavy write activity can cause excessive locking,
     leading to poor performance.  In fact, write performance is
     often worse than that of a single server.  Read requests can
     be sent to any server.  Some implementations use shared disk
     to reduce the communication overhead.  Synchronous multimaster
     replication is best for mostly read workloads, though its big
     advantage is that any server can accept write requests &mdash;
     there is no need to partition workloads between master and
     standby servers, and because the data changes are sent from one
     server to another, there is no problem with non-deterministic
     functions like <function>random()</>.
    </para>

    <para>
     <productname>PostgreSQL</> does not offer this type of replication,
     though <productname>PostgreSQL</> two-phase commit (<xref
     linkend="sql-prepare-transaction"> and <xref
     linkend="sql-commit-prepared">)
     can be used to implement this in application code or middleware.

   <term>Data Partitioning</term>
   <listitem>

    <para>
     Data partitioning splits tables into data sets.  Each set can
     be modified by only one server.  For example, data can be
     partitioned by offices, e.g., London and Paris, with a server
     in each office.  If queries combining London and Paris data
     are necessary, an application can query both servers, or
     master/standby replication can be used to keep a read-only copy
     of the other office's data on each server.

     Many of the above solutions allow multiple servers to handle multiple

     complete faster.  This solution allows multiple servers to work
     concurrently on a single query.  It is usually accomplished by
     splitting the data among servers and having each server execute its
     part of the query and return results to a central server where they
     are combined and returned to the user.  <productname>Pgpool-II</>
     has this capability.  Also, this can be implemented using the

 <sect1 id="warm-standby">
 <title>Log-Shipping Standby Servers</title>


  <para>
   Continuous archiving can be used to create a <firstterm>high
   availability</> (HA) cluster configuration with one or more
   <firstterm>standby servers</> ready to take over operations if the
   primary server fails. This capability is widely referred to as
   <firstterm>warm standby</> or <firstterm>log shipping</>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The primary and standby server work together to provide this capability,
   though the servers are only loosely coupled. The primary server operates
   in continuous archiving mode, while each standby server operates in
   continuous recovery mode, reading the WAL files from the primary. No
   changes to the database tables are required to enable this capability,
   so it offers low administration overhead compared to some other
   replication solutions. This configuration also has relatively low
   performance impact on the primary server.
  </para>

  <para>
   Directly moving WAL records from one database server to another
   is typically described as log shipping. <productname>PostgreSQL</>
   implements file-based log shipping by transferring WAL records
   one file (WAL segment) at a time. WAL files (16MB) can be
   shipped easily and cheaply over any distance, whether it be to an
   adjacent system, another system at the same site, or another system on
   the far side of the globe. The bandwidth required for this technique
   varies according to the transaction rate of the primary server.
   Record-based log shipping is more granular and streams WAL changes
   incrementally over a network connection (see <xref
   linkend="streaming-replication">).
  </para>

  <para>
   It should be noted that log shipping is asynchronous, i.e., the WAL
   records are shipped after transaction commit. As a result, there is a
   window for data loss should the primary server suffer a catastrophic
   failure; transactions not yet shipped will be lost.  The size of the
   data loss window in file-based log shipping can be limited by use of the
   <varname>archive_timeout</varname> parameter, which can be set as low
   as a few seconds.  However such a low setting will
   substantially increase the bandwidth required for file shipping.
   Streaming replication (see <xref linkend="streaming-replication">)
   allows a much smaller window of data loss.
  </para>

  <para>
   Recovery performance is sufficiently good that the standby will
   typically be only moments away from full
   availability once it has been activated. As a result, this is called
   a warm standby configuration which offers high
   availability. Restoring a server from an archived base backup and
   rollforward will take considerably longer, so that technique only
   offers a solution for disaster recovery, not high availability.
   A standby server can also be used for read-only queries, in which case
   it is called a Hot Standby server. See <xref linkend="hot-standby"> for
   more information.

  <sect2 id="standby-planning">
   <title>Planning</title>

   <para>
    It is usually wise to create the primary and standby servers
    so that they are as similar as possible, at least from the
    perspective of the database server.  In particular, the path names
    associated with tablespaces will be passed across unmodified, so both
    primary and standby servers must have the same mount paths for
    tablespaces if that feature is used.  Keep in mind that if
    <xref linkend="sql-createtablespace">
    is executed on the primary, any new mount point needed for it must
    be created on the primary and all standby servers before the command
    is executed. Hardware need not be exactly the same, but experience shows
    that maintaining two identical systems is easier than maintaining two
    dissimilar ones over the lifetime of the application and system.
    In any case the hardware architecture must be the same &mdash; shipping
    from, say, a 32-bit to a 64-bit system will not work.
   </para>

   <para>
    In general, log shipping between servers running different major
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> release
    levels is not possible. It is the policy of the PostgreSQL Global
    Development Group not to make changes to disk formats during minor release
    upgrades, so it is likely that running different minor release levels
    on primary and standby servers will work successfully. However, no
    formal support for that is offered and you are advised to keep primary
    and standby servers at the same release level as much as possible.
    When updating to a new minor release, the safest policy is to update
    the standby servers first &mdash; a new minor release is more likely
    to be able to read WAL files from a previous minor release than vice
    versa.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="standby-server-operation">
   <title>Standby Server Operation</title>

   <para>
    In standby mode, the server continuously applies WAL received from the
    master server. The standby server can read WAL from a WAL archive
    (see <xref linkend="restore-command">) or directly from the master
    over a TCP connection (streaming replication). The standby server will
    also attempt to restore any WAL found in the standby cluster's
    <filename>pg_xlog</> directory. That typically happens after a server
    restart, when the standby replays again WAL that was streamed from the
    master before the restart, but you can also manually copy files to
    <filename>pg_xlog</> at any time to have them replayed.
   </para>

   <para>
    At startup, the standby begins by restoring all WAL available in the
    archive location, calling <varname>restore_command</>. Once it
    reaches the end of WAL available there and <varname>restore_command</>
    fails, it tries to restore any WAL available in the <filename>pg_xlog</> directory.
    If that fails, and streaming replication has been configured, the
    standby tries to connect to the primary server and start streaming WAL
    from the last valid record found in archive or <filename>pg_xlog</>. If that fails
    or streaming replication is not configured, or if the connection is
    later disconnected, the standby goes back to step 1 and tries to
    restore the file from the archive again. This loop of retries from the
    archive, <filename>pg_xlog</>, and via streaming replication goes on until the server
    is stopped or failover is triggered by a trigger file.
   </para>

   <para>
    Standby mode is exited and the server switches to normal operation
    when <command>pg_ctl promote</> is run or a trigger file is found
    (<varname>trigger_file</>). Before failover,
    any WAL immediately available in the archive or in <filename>pg_xlog</> will be
    restored, but no attempt is made to connect to the master.

   <para>
    Streaming replication allows a standby server to stay more up-to-date
    than is possible with file-based log shipping. The standby connects
    to the primary, which streams WAL records to the standby as they're
    generated, without waiting for the WAL file to be filled.
   </para>

   <para>
    Streaming replication is asynchronous by default
    (see <xref linkend="synchronous-replication">), in which case there is
    a small delay between committing a transaction in the primary and the
    changes becoming visible in the standby. This delay is however much
    smaller than with file-based log shipping, typically under one second
    assuming the standby is powerful enough to keep up with the load. With
    streaming replication, <varname>archive_timeout</> is not required to
    reduce the data loss window.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you use streaming replication without file-based continuous
    archiving, you have to set <varname>wal_keep_segments</> in the master
    to a value high enough to ensure that old WAL segments are not recycled
    too early, while the standby might still need them to catch up. If the
    standby falls behind too much, it needs to be reinitialized from a new
    base backup. If you set up a WAL archive that's accessible from the
    standby, <varname>wal_keep_segments</> is not required as the standby can always
    use the archive to catch up.
   </para>

   <para>
    To use streaming replication, set up a file-based log-shipping standby
    server as described in <xref linkend="warm-standby">. The step that
    turns a file-based log-shipping standby into streaming replication
    standby is setting <varname>primary_conninfo</> setting in the
    <filename>recovery.conf</> file to point to the primary server. Set
    <xref linkend="guc-listen-addresses"> and authentication options
    (see <filename>pg_hba.conf</>) on the primary so that the standby server
    can connect to the <literal>replication</> pseudo-database on the primary

    <para>
     It is very important that the access privileges for replication be set up

     easy to extract privileged information from it.  Standby servers must
     authenticate to the primary as an account that has the
     <literal>REPLICATION</> privilege. So a role with the
     <literal>REPLICATION</> and <literal>LOGIN</> privileges needs to be
     created on the primary.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      It is recommended that a dedicated user account is used for replication.
      While the <literal>REPLICATION</> privilege is granted to superuser
      accounts by default, it is not recommended to use superuser accounts
      for replication. While <literal>REPLICATION</> privilege gives very high

      primary system, which the <literal>SUPERUSER</> privilege does.

     Client authentication for replication is controlled by a

     <filename>pg_hba.conf</> file on the primary:

     An important health indicator of streaming replication is the amount
     of WAL records generated in the primary, but not yet applied in the
     standby. You can calculate this lag by comparing the current WAL write
     location on the primary with the last WAL location received by the
     standby. They can be retrieved using
     <function>pg_current_xlog_location</> on the primary and the

     respectively (see <xref linkend="functions-admin-backup-table"> and

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> streaming replication is asynchronous by
    default. If the primary server
    crashes then some transactions that were committed may not have been
    replicated to the standby server, causing data loss. The amount
    of data loss is proportional to the replication delay at the time of
    failover.
   </para>

   <para>
    Synchronous replication offers the ability to confirm that all changes
    made by a transaction have been transferred to one synchronous standby
    server. This extends the standard level of durability
    offered by a transaction commit. This level of protection is referred
    to as 2-safe replication in computer science theory.
   </para>

   <para>
    When requesting synchronous replication, each commit of a
    write transaction will wait until confirmation is
    received that the commit has been written to the transaction log on disk
    of both the primary and standby server. The only possibility that data
    can be lost is if both the primary and the standby suffer crashes at the
    same time. This can provide a much higher level of durability, though only
    if the sysadmin is cautious about the placement and management of the two
    servers.  Waiting for confirmation increases the user's confidence that the
    changes will not be lost in the event of server crashes but it also
    necessarily increases the response time for the requesting transaction.
    The minimum wait time is the roundtrip time between primary to standby.
   </para>

   <para>
    Read only transactions and transaction rollbacks need not wait for
    replies from standby servers. Subtransaction commits do not wait for
    responses from standby servers, only top-level commits. Long
    running actions such as data loading or index building do not wait
    until the very final commit message. All two-phase commit actions
    require commit waits, including both prepare and commit.
   </para>

   <sect3 id="synchronous-replication-config">
    <title>Basic Configuration</title>

   <para>
    Once streaming replication has been configured, configuring synchronous

    <xref linkend="guc-synchronous-standby-names"> must be set to
    a non-empty value.  <varname>synchronous_commit</> must also be set to
    <literal>on</>, but since this is the default value, typically no change is
    required.  This configuration will cause each commit to wait for
    confirmation that the standby has written the commit record to durable
    storage, even if that takes a very long time.
    <varname>synchronous_commit</> can be set by individual
    users, so can be configured in the configuration file, for particular
    users or databases, or dynamically by applications, in order to control
    the durability guarantee on a per-transaction basis.
   </para>

   <para>
    After a commit record has been written to disk on the primary, the
    WAL record is then sent to the standby. The standby sends reply
    messages each time a new batch of WAL data is written to disk, unless
    <varname>wal_receiver_status_interval</> is set to zero on the standby.
    If the standby is the first matching standby, as specified in
    <varname>synchronous_standby_names</> on the primary, the reply
    messages from that standby will be used to wake users waiting for
    confirmation that the commit record has been received. These parameters
    allow the administrator to specify which standby servers should be
    synchronous standbys. Note that the configuration of synchronous
    replication is mainly on the master.

   <para>
    Users will stop waiting if a fast shutdown is requested.  However, as

   <para>
    Synchronous replication usually requires carefully planned and placed
    standby servers to ensure applications perform acceptably. Waiting
    doesn't utilise system resources, but transaction locks continue to be
    held until the transfer is confirmed. As a result, incautious use of
    synchronous replication will reduce performance for database
    applications because of increased response times and higher contention.
   </para>

   <para>

    For example, an application workload might consist of:
    10% of changes are important customer details, while

    easily survive if it is lost, such as chat messages between users.
   </para>

   <para>
    With synchronous replication options specified at the application level
    (on the primary) we can offer synchronous replication for the most

    Application level options are an important and practical tool for allowing
    the benefits of synchronous replication for high performance applications.

   <para>
    The best solution for avoiding data loss is to ensure you don't lose
    your last remaining sync standby. This can be achieved by naming multiple
    potential synchronous standbys using <varname>synchronous_standby_names</>.
    The first named standby will be used as the synchronous standby. Standbys
    listed after this will take over the role of synchronous standby if the
    first one should fail.

   <para>
    When a standby first attaches to the primary, it will not yet be properly
    synchronized. This is described as <literal>catchup</> mode. Once
    the lag between standby and primary reaches zero for the first time
    we move to real-time <literal>streaming</> state.
    The catch-up duration may be long immediately after the standby has
    been created. If the standby is shut down, then the catch-up period
    will increase according to the length of time the standby has been down.
    The standby is only able to become a synchronous standby
    once it has reached <literal>streaming</> state.

   <para>
    If primary restarts while commits are waiting for acknowledgement, those
    waiting transactions will be marked fully committed once the primary
    database recovers.
    There is no way to be certain that all standbys have received all
    outstanding WAL data at time of the crash of the primary. Some
    transactions may not show as committed on the standby, even though
    they show as committed on the primary. The guarantee we offer is that
    the application will not receive explicit acknowledgement of the
    successful commit of a transaction until the WAL data is known to be
    safely received by the standby.

   <para>
    If the standby server fails then no failover need take place. If the
    standby server can be restarted, even some time later, then the recovery
    process can also be restarted immediately, taking advantage of
    restartable recovery. If the standby server cannot be restarted, then a
    full new standby server instance should be created.
   </para>

   <para>
    If the primary server fails and the standby server becomes the
    new primary, and then the old primary restarts, you must have
    a mechanism for informing the old primary that it is no longer the primary. This is
    sometimes known as <acronym>STONITH</> (Shoot The Other Node In The Head), which is
    necessary to avoid situations where both systems think they are the
    primary, which will lead to confusion and ultimately data loss.
   </para>

   <para>
    Many failover systems use just two systems, the primary and the standby,
    connected by some kind of heartbeat mechanism to continually verify the
    connectivity between the two and the viability of the primary. It is
    also possible to use a third system (called a witness server) to prevent
    some cases of inappropriate failover, but the additional complexity
    might not be worthwhile unless it is set up with sufficient care and
    rigorous testing.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> does not provide the system
    software required to identify a failure on the primary and notify
    the standby database server.  Many such tools exist and are well
    integrated with the operating system facilities required for
    successful failover, such as IP address migration.
   </para>

   <para>
    Once failover to the standby occurs, there is only a
    single server in operation. This is known as a degenerate state.
    The former standby is now the primary, but the former primary is down
    and might stay down.  To return to normal operation, a standby server
    must be recreated,
    either on the former primary system when it comes up, or on a third,
    possibly new, system. Once complete, the primary and standby can be
    considered to have switched roles. Some people choose to use a third
    server to provide backup for the new primary until the new standby
    server is recreated,
    though clearly this complicates the system configuration and
    operational processes.
   </para>

   <para>
    So, switching from primary to standby server can be fast but requires
    some time to re-prepare the failover cluster. Regular switching from
    primary to standby is useful, since it allows regular downtime on
    each system for maintenance. This also serves as a test of the
    failover mechanism to ensure that it will really work when you need it.
    Written administration procedures are advised.
   </para>

   <para>
    To trigger failover of a log-shipping standby server,
    run <command>pg_ctl promote</> or create a trigger
    file with the file name and path specified by the <varname>trigger_file</>

    <command>pg_ctl promote</> to fail over, <varname>trigger_file</> is
    not required. If you're setting up the reporting servers that are
    only used to offload read-only queries from the primary, not for high
    availability purposes, you don't need to promote it.

  <sect1 id="log-shipping-alternative">
   <title>Alternative Method for Log Shipping</title>

   <para>
    An alternative to the built-in standby mode described in the previous
    sections is to use a <varname>restore_command</> that polls the archive location.
    This was the only option available in versions 8.4 and below. In this
    setup, set <varname>standby_mode</> off, because you are implementing
    the polling required for standby operation yourself. See the
    <xref linkend="pgstandby"> module for a reference
    implementation of this.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that in this mode, the server will apply WAL one file at a
    time, so if you use the standby server for queries (see Hot Standby),
    there is a delay between an action in the master and when the
    action becomes visible in the standby, corresponding the time it takes
    to fill up the WAL file. <varname>archive_timeout</> can be used to make that delay
    shorter. Also note that you can't combine streaming replication with
    this method.
   </para>

   <para>
    The operations that occur on both primary and standby servers are
    normal continuous archiving and recovery tasks. The only point of
    contact between the two database servers is the archive of WAL files
    that both share: primary writing to the archive, standby reading from
    the archive. Care must be taken to ensure that WAL archives from separate
    primary servers do not become mixed together or confused. The archive
    need not be large if it is only required for standby operation.
   </para>

   <para>
    The magic that makes the two loosely coupled servers work together is
    simply a <varname>restore_command</> used on the standby that,
    when asked for the next WAL file, waits for it to become available from
    the primary. The <varname>restore_command</> is specified in the
    <filename>recovery.conf</> file on the standby server. Normal recovery
    processing would request a file from the WAL archive, reporting failure
    if the file was unavailable.  For standby processing it is normal for
    the next WAL file to be unavailable, so the standby must wait for
    it to appear. For files ending in <literal>.backup</> or
    <literal>.history</> there is no need to wait, and a non-zero return
    code must be returned. A waiting <varname>restore_command</> can be
    written as a custom script that loops after polling for the existence of
    the next WAL file. There must also be some way to trigger failover, which
    should interrupt the <varname>restore_command</>, break the loop and
    return a file-not-found error to the standby server. This ends recovery
    and the standby will then come up as a normal server.
   </para>

   <para>
    Pseudocode for a suitable <varname>restore_command</> is:
<programlisting>
triggered = false;
while (!NextWALFileReady() &amp;&amp; !triggered)
{
    sleep(100000L);         /* wait for ~0.1 sec */
    if (CheckForExternalTrigger())
        triggered = true;
}
if (!triggered)
        CopyWALFileForRecovery();
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    A working example of a waiting <varname>restore_command</> is provided
    in the <xref linkend="pgstandby"> module. It
    should be used as a reference on how to correctly implement the logic
    described above. It can also be extended as needed to support specific
    configurations and environments.
   </para>

   <para>
    The method for triggering failover is an important part of planning
    and design. One potential option is the <varname>restore_command</>
    command.  It is executed once for each WAL file, but the process
    running the <varname>restore_command</> is created and dies for
    each file, so there is no daemon or server process, and
    signals or a signal handler cannot be used. Therefore, the
    <varname>restore_command</> is not suitable to trigger failover.
    It is possible to use a simple timeout facility, especially if
    used in conjunction with a known <varname>archive_timeout</>
    setting on the primary. However, this is somewhat error prone
    since a network problem or busy primary server might be sufficient
    to initiate failover. A notification mechanism such as the explicit
    creation of a trigger file is ideal, if this can be arranged.

    Recovery treats the WAL archive as read-only, so once a WAL file has
    been copied to the standby system it can be copied to tape at the same
    time as it is being read by the standby database server.
    Thus, running a standby server for high availability can be performed at
    the same time as files are stored for longer term disaster recovery
    purposes.

   <para>
    Hot Standby is the term used to describe the ability to connect to
    the server and run read-only queries while the server is in archive
    recovery or standby mode. This
    is useful both for replication purposes and for restoring a backup
    to a desired state with great precision.
    The term Hot Standby also refers to the ability of the server to move
    from recovery through to normal operation while users continue running
    queries and/or keep their connections open.
   </para>

   <para>
    Running queries in hot standby mode is similar to normal query operation,
    though there are several usage and administrative differences
    explained below.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="hot-standby-users">
   <title>User's Overview</title>

   <para>
    When the <xref linkend="guc-hot-standby"> parameter is set to true on a
    standby server, it will begin accepting connections once the recovery has
    brought the system to a consistent state.  All such connections are
    strictly read-only; not even temporary tables may be written.
   </para>

   <para>
    The data on the standby takes some time to arrive from the primary server
    so there will be a measurable delay between primary and standby. Running the
    same query nearly simultaneously on both primary and standby might therefore
    return differing results. We say that data on the standby is
    <firstterm>eventually consistent</firstterm> with the primary.  Once the
    commit record for a transaction is replayed on the standby, the changes
    made by that transaction will be visible to any new snapshots taken on
    the standby.  Snapshots may be taken at the start of each query or at the
    start of each transaction, depending on the current transaction isolation
    level.  For more details, see <xref linkend="transaction-iso">.

    database connection.  If failover or switchover occurs, the database will
    switch to normal processing mode.  Sessions will remain connected while the
    server changes mode.  Once hot standby finishes, it will be possible to
    initiate read-write transactions (even from a session begun during
    hot standby).

   <title>Handling Query Conflicts</title>

   <para>
    The primary and standby servers are in many ways loosely connected. Actions
    on the primary will have an effect on the standby. As a result, there is
    potential for negative interactions or conflicts between them. The easiest
    conflict to understand is performance: if a huge data load is taking place
    on the primary then this will generate a similar stream of WAL records on the
    standby, so standby queries may contend for system resources, such as I/O.
   </para>

   <para>
    There are also additional types of conflict that can occur with Hot Standby.
    These conflicts are <emphasis>hard conflicts</> in the sense that queries

       </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    On the primary server, these cases simply result in waiting; and the
    user might choose to cancel either of the conflicting actions.  However,
    on the standby there is no choice: the WAL-logged action already occurred
    on the primary so the standby must not fail to apply it.  Furthermore,
    allowing WAL application to wait indefinitely may be very undesirable,
    because the standby's state will become increasingly far behind the
    primary's.  Therefore, a mechanism is provided to forcibly cancel standby
    queries that conflict with to-be-applied WAL records.
   </para>

   <para>
    An example of the problem situation is an administrator on the primary
    server running <command>DROP TABLE</> on a table that is currently being
    queried on the standby server.  Clearly the standby query cannot continue
    if the <command>DROP TABLE</> is applied on the standby. If this situation
    occurred on the primary, the <command>DROP TABLE</> would wait until the
    other query had finished. But when <command>DROP TABLE</> is run on the
    primary, the primary doesn't have information about what queries are
    running on the standby, so it will not wait for any such standby
    queries. The WAL change records come through to the standby while the
    standby query is still running, causing a conflict.  The standby server
    must either delay application of the WAL records (and everything after
    them, too) or else cancel the conflicting query so that the <command>DROP
    TABLE</> can be applied.
   </para>

   <para>
    When a conflicting query is short, it's typically desirable to allow it to
    complete by delaying WAL application for a little bit; but a long delay in
    WAL application is usually not desirable.  So the cancel mechanism has
    parameters, <xref linkend="guc-max-standby-archive-delay"> and <xref
    linkend="guc-max-standby-streaming-delay">, that define the maximum
    allowed delay in WAL application.  Conflicting queries will be canceled
    once it has taken longer than the relevant delay setting to apply any
    newly-received WAL data.  There are two parameters so that different delay
    values can be specified for the case of reading WAL data from an archive
    (i.e., initial recovery from a base backup or <quote>catching up</> a
    standby server that has fallen far behind) versus reading WAL data via
    streaming replication.
   </para>

   <para>
    In a standby server that exists primarily for high availability, it's
    best to set the delay parameters relatively short, so that the server
    cannot fall far behind the primary due to delays caused by standby
    queries.  However, if the standby server is meant for executing
    long-running queries, then a high or even infinite delay value may be
    preferable.  Keep in mind however that a long-running query could
    cause other sessions on the standby server to not see recent changes
    on the primary, if it delays application of WAL records.
   </para>

   <para>
    Once the delay specified by <varname>max_standby_archive_delay</> or
    <varname>max_standby_streaming_delay</> has been exceeded, conflicting
    queries will be canceled.  This usually results just in a cancellation
    error, although in the case of replaying a <command>DROP DATABASE</>
    the entire conflicting session will be terminated.  Also, if the conflict
    is over a lock held by an idle transaction, the conflicting session is
    terminated (this behavior might change in the future).
   </para>

   <para>
    Canceled queries may be retried immediately (after beginning a new
    transaction, of course).  Since query cancellation depends on
    the nature of the WAL records being replayed, a query that was
    canceled may well succeed if it is executed again.
   </para>

   <para>
    Keep in mind that the delay parameters are compared to the elapsed time
    since the WAL data was received by the standby server.  Thus, the grace
    period allowed to any one query on the standby is never more than the
    delay parameter, and could be considerably less if the standby has already
    fallen behind as a result of waiting for previous queries to complete, or
    as a result of being unable to keep up with a heavy update load.
   </para>

   <para>
    The most common reason for conflict between standby queries and WAL replay
    is <quote>early cleanup</>.  Normally, <productname>PostgreSQL</> allows
    cleanup of old row versions when there are no transactions that need to
    see them to ensure correct visibility of data according to MVCC rules.
    However, this rule can only be applied for transactions executing on the
    master.  So it is possible that cleanup on the master will remove row
    versions that are still visible to a transaction on the standby.
   </para>

   <para>
    Experienced users should note that both row version cleanup and row version
    freezing will potentially conflict with standby queries. Running a manual
    <command>VACUUM FREEZE</> is likely to cause conflicts even on tables with
    no updated or deleted rows.
   </para>

   <para>
    Users should be clear that tables that are regularly and heavily updated
    on the primary server will quickly cause cancellation of longer running
    queries on the standby. In such cases the setting of a finite value for
    <varname>max_standby_archive_delay</> or
    <varname>max_standby_streaming_delay</> can be considered similar to
    setting <varname>statement_timeout</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Remedial possibilities exist if the number of standby-query cancellations
    is found to be unacceptable.  The first option is to set the parameter
    <varname>hot_standby_feedback</>, which prevents <command>VACUUM</> from
    removing recently-dead rows and so cleanup conflicts do not occur.
    If you do this, you
    should note that this will delay cleanup of dead rows on the primary,
    which may result in undesirable table bloat. However, the cleanup
    situation will be no worse than if the standby queries were running
    directly on the primary server, and you are still getting the benefit of
    off-loading execution onto the standby.
    <varname>max_standby_archive_delay</> must be kept large in this case,
    because delayed WAL files might already contain entries that conflict with
    the desired standby queries.
   </para>

   <para>
    Another option is to increase <xref linkend="guc-vacuum-defer-cleanup-age">
    on the primary server, so that dead rows will not be cleaned up as quickly
    as they normally would be.  This will allow more time for queries to
    execute before they are canceled on the standby, without having to set
    a high <varname>max_standby_streaming_delay</>.  However it is
    difficult to guarantee any specific execution-time window with this
    approach, since <varname>vacuum_defer_cleanup_age</> is measured in
    transactions executed on the primary server.
   </para>

   <para>
    The number of query cancels and the reason for them can be viewed using
    the <structname>pg_stat_database_conflicts</> system view on the standby
    server. The <structname>pg_stat_database</> system view also contains
    summary information.

    If <varname>hot_standby</> is turned <literal>on</> in
    <filename>postgresql.conf</> and there is a <filename>recovery.conf</>
    file present, the server will run in Hot Standby mode.
    However, it may take some time for Hot Standby connections to be allowed,
    because the server will not accept connections until it has completed
    sufficient recovery to provide a consistent state against which queries
    can run.  During this period,
    clients that attempt to connect will be refused with an error message.
    To confirm the server has come up, either loop trying to connect from
    the application, or look for these messages in the server logs:

<programlisting>
LOG:  entering standby mode

... then some time later ...

LOG:  consistent recovery state reached
LOG:  database system is ready to accept read only connections
</programlisting>

    Consistency information is recorded once per checkpoint on the primary.
    It is not possible to enable hot standby when reading WAL
    written during a period when <varname>wal_level</> was not set to
    <literal>hot_standby</> on the primary.  Reaching a consistent state can
    also be delayed in the presence of both of these conditions:

    The setting of some parameters on the standby will need reconfiguration

    It is important that the administrator select appropriate settings for
    <xref linkend="guc-max-standby-archive-delay"> and <xref
    linkend="guc-max-standby-streaming-delay">.  The best choices vary
    depending on business priorities.  For example if the server is primarily
    tasked as a High Availability server, then you will want low delay
    settings, perhaps even zero, though that is a very aggressive setting. If
    the standby server is tasked as an additional server for decision support
    queries then it might be acceptable to set the maximum delay values to
    many hours, or even -1 which means wait forever for queries to complete.
   </para>

   <para>
    Transaction status "hint bits" written on the primary are not WAL-logged,
    so data on the standby will likely re-write the hints again on the standby.
    Thus, the standby server will still perform disk writes even though
    all users are read-only; no changes occur to the data values
    themselves.  Users will still write large sort temporary files and
    re-generate relcache info files, so no part of the database
    is truly read-only during hot standby mode.
    Note also that writes to remote databases using
    <application>dblink</application> module, and other operations outside the
    database using PL functions will still be possible, even though the
    transaction is read-only locally.
   </para>

   <para>
    The following types of administration commands are not accepted
    during recovery mode:

      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Data Definition Language (DDL) - e.g. <command>CREATE INDEX</>
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Privilege and Ownership - <command>GRANT</>, <command>REVOKE</>,
         <command>REASSIGN</>
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Maintenance commands - <command>ANALYZE</>, <command>VACUUM</>,
         <command>CLUSTER</>, <command>REINDEX</>
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    Again, note that some of these commands are actually allowed during
    "read only" mode transactions on the primary.
   </para>

   <para>
    As a result, you cannot create additional indexes that exist solely
    on the standby, nor statistics that exist solely on the standby.
    If these administration commands are needed, they should be executed
    on the primary, and eventually those changes will propagate to the
    standby.
   </para>

   <para>
    <function>pg_cancel_backend()</> will work on user backends, but not the
    Startup process, which performs recovery. <structname>pg_stat_activity</structname> does not
    show an entry for the Startup process, nor do recovering transactions
    show as active. As a result, <structname>pg_prepared_xacts</structname> is always empty during
    recovery. If you wish to resolve in-doubt prepared transactions,
    view <literal>pg_prepared_xacts</> on the primary and issue commands to
    resolve transactions there.
   </para>

   <para>
    <structname>pg_locks</structname> will show locks held by backends,
    as normal. <structname>pg_locks</structname> also shows
    a virtual transaction managed by the Startup process that owns all
    <literal>AccessExclusiveLocks</> held by transactions being replayed by recovery.
    Note that the Startup process does not acquire locks to
    make database changes, and thus locks other than <literal>AccessExclusiveLocks</>
    do not show in <structname>pg_locks</structname> for the Startup
    process; they are just presumed to exist.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <productname>Nagios</> plugin <productname>check_pgsql</> will
    work, because the simple information it checks for exists.
    The <productname>check_postgres</> monitoring script will also work,
    though some reported values could give different or confusing results.
    For example, last vacuum time will not be maintained, since no
    vacuum occurs on the standby.  Vacuums running on the primary
    do still send their changes to the standby.
   </para>

   <para>
    WAL file control commands will not work during recovery,
    e.g. <function>pg_start_backup</>, <function>pg_switch_xlog</> etc.
   </para>

   <para>
    Dynamically loadable modules work, including <structname>pg_stat_statements</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Advisory locks work normally in recovery, including deadlock detection.
    Note that advisory locks are never WAL logged, so it is impossible for
    an advisory lock on either the primary or the standby to conflict with WAL
    replay. Nor is it possible to acquire an advisory lock on the primary
    and have it initiate a similar advisory lock on the standby. Advisory
    locks relate only to the server on which they are acquired.
   </para>

   <para>
    Trigger-based replication systems such as <productname>Slony</>,
    <productname>Londiste</> and <productname>Bucardo</> won't run on the
    standby at all, though they will run happily on the primary server as
    long as the changes are not sent to standby servers to be applied.
    WAL replay is not trigger-based so you cannot relay from the
    standby to any system that requires additional database writes or
    relies on the use of triggers.
   </para>

   <para>
    New OIDs cannot be assigned, though some <acronym>UUID</> generators may still
    work as long as they do not rely on writing new status to the database.
   </para>

   <para>
    Currently, temporary table creation is not allowed during read only
    transactions, so in some cases existing scripts will not run correctly.
    This restriction might be relaxed in a later release. This is
    both a SQL Standard compliance issue and a technical issue.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>DROP TABLESPACE</> can only succeed if the tablespace is empty.
    Some standby users may be actively using the tablespace via their
    <varname>temp_tablespaces</> parameter. If there are temporary files in the
    tablespace, all active queries are canceled to ensure that temporary
    files are removed, so the tablespace can be removed and WAL replay
    can continue.
   </para>

   <para>
    Running <command>DROP DATABASE</> or <command>ALTER DATABASE ... SET
    TABLESPACE</> on the primary
    will generate a WAL entry that will cause all users connected to that
    database on the standby to be forcibly disconnected. This action occurs
    immediately, whatever the setting of
    <varname>max_standby_streaming_delay</>. Note that
    <command>ALTER DATABASE ... RENAME</> does not disconnect users, which
    in most cases will go unnoticed, though might in some cases cause a
    program confusion if it depends in some way upon database name.
   </para>

   <para>
    In normal (non-recovery) mode, if you issue <command>DROP USER</> or <command>DROP ROLE</>
    for a role with login capability while that user is still connected then
    nothing happens to the connected user - they remain connected. The user cannot
    reconnect however. This behavior applies in recovery also, so a
    <command>DROP USER</> on the primary does not disconnect that user on the standby.
   </para>

   <para>
    The statistics collector is active during recovery. All scans, reads, blocks,
    index usage, etc., will be recorded normally on the standby. Replayed
    actions will not duplicate their effects on primary, so replaying an
    insert will not increment the Inserts column of pg_stat_user_tables.
    The stats file is deleted at the start of recovery, so stats from primary
    and standby will differ; this is considered a feature, not a bug.
   </para>

   <para>
    Autovacuum is not active during recovery.  It will start normally at the
    end of recovery.
   </para>

   <para>
    The background writer is active during recovery and will perform
    restartpoints (similar to checkpoints on the primary) and normal block
    cleaning activities. This can include updates of the hint bit
    information stored on the standby server.
    The <command>CHECKPOINT</> command is accepted during recovery,
    though it performs a restartpoint rather than a new checkpoint.

    There are several limitations of Hot Standby.
    These can and probably will be fixed in future releases:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Operations on hash indexes are not presently WAL-logged, so
     replay will not update these indexes.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Full knowledge of running transactions is required before snapshots
     can be taken. Transactions that use large numbers of subtransactions
     (currently greater than 64) will delay the start of read only
     connections until the completion of the longest running write transaction.
     If this situation occurs, explanatory messages will be sent to the server log.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Valid starting points for standby queries are generated at each
     checkpoint on the master. If the standby is shut down while the master
     is in a shutdown state, it might not be possible to re-enter Hot Standby
     until the primary is started up, so that it generates further starting
     points in the WAL logs.  This situation isn't a problem in the most
     common situations where it might happen. Generally, if the primary is
     shut down and not available anymore, that's likely due to a serious
     failure that requires the standby being converted to operate as
     the new primary anyway.  And in situations where the primary is
     being intentionally taken down, coordinating to make sure the standby
     becomes the new primary smoothly is also standard procedure.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     At the end of recovery, <literal>AccessExclusiveLocks</> held by prepared transactions
     will require twice the normal number of lock table entries. If you plan
     on running either a large number of concurrent prepared transactions
     that normally take <literal>AccessExclusiveLocks</>, or you plan on having one
     large transaction that takes many <literal>AccessExclusiveLocks</>, you are
     advised to select a larger value of <varname>max_locks_per_transaction</>,
     perhaps as much as twice the value of the parameter on
     the primary server. You need not consider this at all if
     your setting of <varname>max_prepared_transactions</> is 0.

     The Serializable transaction isolation level is not yet available in hot

     An attempt to set a transaction to the serializable isolation level in
     hot standby mode will generate an error.
