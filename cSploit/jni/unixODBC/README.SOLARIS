Building unixODBC on Solaris
----------------------------

This should just work, however I have had the following helpfull
hints sent to me by David Brown of Starquest. The suggested change
has been made to the code in __info.c

"Last fall, I had problems running on Solaris 7, because my system did have
an iconv conversion between ISO8859-1 and UCS-2.

I discovered two things:

* the missing iconv tables are available by a patch for Solaris 7 (there is
also a corresponding patch for Solaris 8, that fixes a lot in this area -
seems recommended to use that as well)

* Solaris uses the name 8859-1 in its tables rather than ISO8859-1 or
ISO-8859-1.


So what I've done is:

1) make the following change to DriverManager/__info.c:

diff __info.c __info.c.orig
385c385
<     char *asc[] = { "char", "ISO8859-1", "ISO-8859-1", "8859-1", "ASCII", NULL
 };
 ---

 >>     char *asc[] = { "char", "ISO8859-1", "ISO-8859-1", "ASCII", NULL };

 2) tell customers to apply the following Solaris patches:

 Solaris 7:
 Patch-ID# 112689-02
 Keywords: UTF-8 ICONV
 Synopsis: SunOS 5.7: UTF-8 locale ICONV patch
 Date: Aug/28/2002

 Solaris 8:
 Patch-ID# 113261-01
 Keywords: UTF-8 ICONV
 Synopsis: SunOS 5.8: UTF-8 locale ICONV patch
 Date: Oct/11/2002

 this has since been superceded by 11326-02, but I think unixODBC should
 function fine with 113261-01

 Patch-ID# 113261-02
 Keywords: UTF-8 ICONV
 Synopsis: SunOS 5.8: UTF-8 locale ICONV patch
 Date: Feb/21/2003"
