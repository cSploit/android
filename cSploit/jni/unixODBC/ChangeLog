      Thanks for the change from the folks at Acision.

      original open failed but the file did exist

	* Alter how the Ansi-Unicode mapping is done, so a unicode function can be 
	  passed to the driver (if it supports it) even if a non unicode connect was done
	* Fix buffer overrun in SQLDriverConnectW and SQLColAttributesW
	* I have cut back on a lot of the GUI parts that are being added. The goal is to
	  create a distinct set of files that contains these and other parts that are
	  not part of the core goal of providing ODBC. Likewise the drivers will go on the 
	  next release, as most DB's now have their own folk working on their drivers
	  and they all interoperate with unixODBC so its just adding confusion including them
	  here (IMHO that is)
	* Prevent a potential buffer overrun in the DM
	* The processing of --enable-rtldgroup had been dropped, back now

	  allows this choice at build time

	* Check for existance of qt-mt lib before adding to link line
	* added missing cleanup in Postgres driver

	* Avoid calling SQLGetInfo for every SQLEndTran/SQLTransact
	* Remove inconsistency in the return value from SQLGetPrivateProfileString
	* Fix broken QT_VERSION detection

	* More informative error message if a invalid handle is passed to SQLAllocHandle
	* Add TIMESTAMP_NO_TMZONE to Postgres drivers types

    * Remove the SQLNumResults() call after a execute. This means the
      DM doesn't know if there is a result set, but it seems to match
      what the MS one is doing.

      the driver returned a error.

    * Add configure option to force the way dlopen works
    * Fix bug in stats collection 
    * Add call to endpwent() to avoid a small leak
    * Allow isql to handle SQLMoreResults
    * Add option TracePid in [ODBC] section of odbcinst.ini, setting
      this makes the DM treat the TracePath as a path to a directory, 
      and creates seperate log file for eack PID in use, mainly of
      use when used under something like apache.
    * Add extra unicode string for Solaris, see README.SOLARIS
