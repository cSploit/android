| Driver for internet News Servers                            |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

This is Ke Jin's NN ODBC driver, adapted for unixODBC. Ke Jin's
original README is in README.orig.

This is a first pass at the effort to integrate it into
unixODBC. It works, in its current state, but much more needs
to be done (see the TODO).

THIS CODE IS FUNCTIONAL BUT IS IN MID-HACK; ONLY THE MOST
ADVENTUROUS SHOULD EVEN TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT IN ITS
CURRENT STATE. - PAH

The basic concept is that a news server is like a
SERVER/DATABASE, a news group is like a TABLE, and data such
as Subject is a COLUMN.

A useful subset of SQL is supported in the driver. Check out
Ke Jins original README (README.orig).

This driver can be quite usefull so I hope someone volunteers
to tackle some of the items in the TODO list.
