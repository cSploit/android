+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Some unixODBC drivers have been coded from scratch while others
have been integerated (tweeked to compile and tested) into
unixODBC.

It is unlikely that you have all of the required
libs to build all of these drivers so edit the Makefile
in this dir... comment out any unwanted drivers.

Getting all drivers up to the latest ODBC Level (ie 3.51) is
an ongoing effort. You will find that each driver will implement
a different level of compliance but, hopefully, enough to be
quite usefull.

If you develop a new driver than please let us know. We have
created a Template to help you (see template dir).

Drivers which are under development or are currently being
tested with unixODBC may not be included in this distribution
and some others may have to be downloaded from the DBMS vendor.

The txt and nn drivers are good candidates for testing when
you do not want to install a full DBMS. The txt driver will 
use a text file based database which may take a bit of time
to understand in terms of setting it up. The nn driver uses
internet News Servers as a data server so it is, perhaps, the
easiest to get started with.
