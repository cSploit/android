| Driver Template                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Use this template as a starting point when creating a new
driver. You can also reference existing unixODBC drivers.

This template provides the infrastructure for a 3.51 compliant
ODBC driver.

A driver created from this template, and in the unixODBC framework
should be easy to port to other platforms. In fact, the Drivers
are the only component which one may want to ensure portability
... the remaining components (including the DriverManager)
strive for interoperability but not portability.
