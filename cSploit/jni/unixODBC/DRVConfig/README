These are the setup libs for the various drivers. There are two
generic ones;

drvcfg1 - SQL servers (host, port etc)
drvcfg2 - file based (database dir)

These are typically installed into the same directory as the 
drivers (often /usr/local/lib) and are denoted by a simple
naming convention (*S.so).

The driver lib and setup lib are key to registering an ODBC
driver - a task which is done by a root user.
