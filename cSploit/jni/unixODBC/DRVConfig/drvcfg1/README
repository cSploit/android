| Driver Config for basic SQL Server options                  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+


This is an example of a driver setup which can be called
by ODBC Config to allow the driver specific options to
be set.

This particular example is for SQL Server type setups
and can be used as a substitute for drivers which serve
SQL Servers but are missing a driver setup of its own.

This is the Driver Config that is used when ODBC Config
does not have a specific config for an installed driver.

Each driver in /etc/odbcinst.ini should have a Setup
entry such as;

Setup = /usr/lib/libodbcminiS.so

This will allow ODBCConfig to prompt for Data Source
options.
