Believed Fixed
--------------
1. code to send COL_NAME and COL_INFO tokens are not in the server stuff.

Needs Fixing
------------
1. Fix formatting of dbprhead/dbprrow...its a little off
   (Anybody care?)
2. dbwritetext() and friends do not work under TDS 7.0
3. There is a bug with the order of returns from ct_results() such that rows
   affected doesn't show up in sqsh.
4. ct-lib placeholders do not work with TDS 7.0+.  To fix 
   this requires either an SQL parser or API modification, 
   because the library has to determine the SQL datatype 
   of the placeholder variable.  
5. ML Mar 21 2009: "freebcp error HINT -b doesnt work", freebcp -n broken. 
6. ML 2 Aug 2012 "SQL Anywhere SQLColumns".  Rewrite SQLColumns query 
   in terms of INFORMATION_SCHEMA to get consistent results.
