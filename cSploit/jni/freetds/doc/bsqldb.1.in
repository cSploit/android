.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS.
.Nm
is a non-interactive equivalent of the "isql" utility programs
distributed by Sybase and Microsoft. Like them, 
.Nm
uses the command "go" on a line by itself as a separator between
batches. The last batch need not be followed by "go".
.Nm
makes use of the DB-Library API provided by FreeTDS. This API is of
course also available to application developers.

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl D Ar database
Database to use.
.It Fl H Ar hostname
hostname Override name of client sent to server.
.It Fl P Ar password
Database server password.
.It Fl S Ar servername
Database server to which to connect.
.It Fl U Ar username
Database server login name. If username is not provided, a domain
login is attempted for TDS 7+ connections.
.It Fl e Ar error_file
Name of file for errors.
.It Fl h
Print column headers with the data to the same file.
.It Fl i Ar input_file
Name of script file, containing SQL.
.It Fl o Ar output_file
Name of output file, holding result data.
.It Fl q
Do not print column metadata, return status, or rowcount. Overrides 
.Fl h Ns .
.It Fl t Ar field_term
Specifies the field terminator. Default is two spaces (' ').
Recognized escape sequences are tab ('\\t'), carriage return ('\\r'),
newline ('\\n'), and backslash ('\\\\').
.It Fl v
Verbose mode, for more information about the DB-Library interaction.
This also reports the result set metadata, including and return code. All
verbose data are written to standard error (or 
.Fl e Ns ), so as not to interfere with the data stream.

.Sh NOTES
.Nm
is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to standard output,
and writes errors to standard error. The 
.Fl i Ns , Fl o Ns , and Fl e
options override these defaults.
.Pp
The source code for 
.Nm
is intended as a model for DB-Library users. DB-Library has a rich set
of functions, and it can be hard sometimes to understand how to use
them, particularly the first time. If you find something about the
source code unclear, you are encouraged to email the author your
comments.
.\"
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits 0 on success, and >0 if the server cannot process the query.
.Pp
For messages with severity > 10, 
.Nm
calls exit(3) with the severity level.  For example, if the severity
level is 16,
.Nm
will return an exit status of 16 to the shell.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in FreeTDS 0.63.

.Sh AUTHORS
The 
.Nm
utility was written by
.An "James K. Lowden" Aq jklowden@freetds.org .
.\"
.Sh BUGS
Microsoft servers as of SQL Server 7.0 SP 3 do not return output
parameters unless the RPC functions are used. This means
.Nm
cannot return output parameters for stored procedures with these
servers.
