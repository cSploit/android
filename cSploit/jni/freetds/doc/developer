So you've got GIT commit access?  Basically here is the low down on how we do
things.

If it's a simple patch and doesn't affect anything outside of that module,
check it in. No post to the list is necessary (appreciated not
necessary), but do make judicious use of commit messages.

If the change is going to break the libtds API, post your intentions to
the list before hand for discussion.

Large changes that do not break the interface, can be checked in (if we
are not in feature freeze) but please post a summary to the list of what
you did and why so the other developers know.

The GIT commit comments should reflect *why* you changed things. i.e.

"Fixed convert bug in tsql.c"
