<h1>Which API should I use?</h1>

  <p>There are three APIs.&nbsp; Any will work with any
  server.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>db-lib</h2>

  <p><tt>db-lib</tt> is the oldest and simplest. It's the only API
  supported by both vendors, which is important to people porting
  applications that use the vendors' libraries. <tt>db-lib</tt> was
  the first API implemented by FreeTDS, and is still the best
  supported, for what that's worth. Anything that can be done in
  FreeTDS can be done through <tt>db-lib</tt>. Among other places,
  <tt>db-lib</tt> is used by PHP.</p>

  <h2>ct-lib</h2>

  <p><tt>ct-lib</tt> is Sybase's second-generation API. People who
  really know Sybase rely on <tt>ct-lib</tt> because it fixes a
  bunch of implementation and conceptual gaps in <tt>db-lib</tt>.
  That's why <tt>sqsh</tt> and Perl's <tt>DBD::Sybase</tt> use
  <tt>ct-lib</tt>. <tt>ct-lib</tt> is not our most complete
  implementation, but is getting some attention from the
  developers. We're committed to making it work perfectly with
  <tt>DBD::Sybase</tt>.</p>

  <h2>odbc</h2>

  <p><tt>ODBC</tt> is our most recent addition. Its chief advantage
  is that it makes FreeTDS servers look like other <tt>ODBC</tt>
  servers, a big help to people who know <tt>ODBC</tt> and/or write
  applications for several kinds of servers. Recent releases of
  FreeTDS have included large expansions of functionality in the
  <tt>ODBC</tt> library, and the CVS version almost always includes
  still more features.</p>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>

  <p>There is no bottom line.&nbsp; The shortest path lies between
  two points that only you, dear reader, know: where you are and
  where you're going.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I like <tt>db-lib</tt> and think it's easy to get to know; it
  has always done what I need.&nbsp; But the real experts out there
  believe in <tt>ct-lib</tt>, so it's probably the right answer for
  people just starting out, unless you want compatibility with
  Microsoft's libraries.&nbsp; FreeTDS swings both ways: you can
  use any client library API to connect to either vendor's
  server.</p>

  <p>Another consideration is what you have for a reference
  platform.&nbsp; If you have access to vendor libraries, it can be
  very handy to use their docs and write small tests against their
  implementation.</p>

  <h2>Where's the documentation?</h2>

  <p>Links to the vendors' library docs are in the <a href=
  "http://www.freetds.org/faq.html">FreeTDS FAQ</a>.</p>

  <h1>What is "bcp"?</h1>

  <p>"bcp" stands for "bulk copy". It is the name Sybase gave to a
  feature of their server and TDS protocol.</p>

  <p>Normal <tt>INSERT</tt> statements are first applied to the
  transaction log and then applied to the table. A bcp insertion,
  on the other hand, never<a href="#footnote.1"><sup>1</sup></a> touches the
  transaction log. It's applied directly to the table and committed
  wholesale. bcp operations are often an order of magnitude faster
  than ordinary inserts, and are easier on the server, too.</p>

  <p>To make bcp possible, Sybase included a feature in the TDS
  protocol to (1) alert the server and (2) structure the incoming
  data such that it's easy for the server to accept them. This
  feature is made accessible to client applications via a set of
  bcp functions in <tt>db-lib</tt> and <tt>ct-lib</tt>.&nbsp;
  (Microsoft's ODBC driver supports bcp as an extension; it's not
  part of the ODBC specification.)&nbsp; The APIs allow the
  programmer to indicate the name of a file to load, or to send
  rows of data from variables inside the application. The latter
  feature is especially useful to the kind of
  numerical/quantitative programming I do for a living; it's rare
  that I'm working with under a million rows.</p>

  <p>Sybase and Microsoft both include a <tt>bcp</tt> utility to
  load/unload the server. It's the standard way to import data from
  another server, for example. FreeTDS hadn't had one (we supply
  the library, you supply the application), but Bill Thompson has
  written <tt>freebcp</tt> (Yay, Bill!) so that gap is filled.</p>

  <p>One sometimes hears of "bcp out" i.e., extracting data to a
  file with the bcp utility. From the server's and protocol's point
  of view, there's no (or almost no) such thing. The real advantage
  of bcp is bypassing the transaction log and its concomitant locks
  and I/O, elements that aren't significant when reading a
  table.</p>

  <p>As far as I know, bcp is a unique feature in the database
  world. Other databases have ways to load data, of course, but not
  via the client protocol.</p>

  <p>RTFM for more.</p>

  <p><a name="footnote.1"><sup>1</sup></a> Actually&mdash;to be
  pedantic about it&mdash;the table allocations are still logged
  (i.e. which pages get allocated during the insert). And you can
  only run the non-logged (aka "fast") bcp if the target table has
  no indexes and there are no triggers.</p>
