  one of these elements.

   of inferring it from the column sizes.

   "WARNING! Some character(s) could not be converted into client's character 
   set. Unconverted bytes were changed to question marks ('?')."

Pre-GNUification log by Brian <camber@ais.org>:

2/8/98	Should be able to send the first packet to a server soon, my output is 
	only slightly different than open clients.
	This codes pretty crappy right now. I need to clean up alot of stuff, 
	remove hardcode values, etc...but I'm anxious to see something work!
2/7/98	Broke the code up a bit, tds.c now handles all wire level stuff, 
	dblib.c handles dblib specific stuff. So, in the future there can be 
	ctlib.c and obdc.c can also sit on top of tds.c to handle the other CLIs
3/16/98 Been working on the code here and there...We can now send a query to 
	the server, dbnumcols() and dbcolname() both work. Almost ready to get
	some data back. I put in a dummy dbbind to just handle strings so,
	I could do some work on dbnextrow().  However, we will have revisit 
	almost everything later.
3/23/98	Haven't been able to work on it lately.  Still trying to decide on the
	best way to propagate the row data from tds.c to dblib.c to the calling
 	func.  Not that hard, but nothing strikes me as the "Right Way" (tm).
4/2/98	Ok we are ready to release 0.01 (marked by the fact that a simple dblib 
	program actually works!)
5/1/98  Haven't updated in quite a while. A few more dblib commands are 
	supported. dbconvert() support is preliminary. Fixed alot of bugs. A
	little bit of cleanup. dbbind() sorta works now, needs work still. 
	At least one mem leak that I know of (haven't gotten around to fixing 
	it.  Wish I had more time to work on it...
5/2/98  Decided to release what I have. executing sp_who seems to mostly work..
	a step in the right direction.  Version 0.02.  Seem to have generated a
	little interest after mentioning it in a usenet post.
5/6/98	Can compile against sqsh!!! Did a reorg on tds.c, all dblib func that 
	read data now go through tds_process_messages() which read the marker
	and calls other routines as necessary. sqsh's output is a little screwy
	(well I don't have a real dbprrow() yet, but the number of result sets 
	coming back is too many).  So, anyway Version 0.04
5/9/98  Decided to upload some new code, mostly just stubs.  Sybperl compiles 
	I can't get my perl to work with it. (I need to download perl and link
	statically, the one that comes on the system won't do).  Anyway,
	most of dblib is present in stub form.
5/17/98 Managed to scrape up some time and release new code. Duplicate result 
	sets went away, and handling of more datatypes (money, bit, more int 
	stuff).  Also, improved dbprhead()/row() function.
5/26/98 Ok, I'm doing the long overdue cleaning up of the code. All the kludges
	should be gone.  Thanks, to everyone who contributed 
	code/idea/corrections.
6/3/98  The majority of the overhaul is done...still some work to do, but this 
        is much better than before. I'm bumping the version to 0.1 signifying 
        that I actually use sqsh compiled against it on a regular basis.	
6/5/98	TDS 4.2 support seems to be working properly
6/26/98 Gregg Jenson has added support for err and msg handling among other 
	things. I've added some prelimary ctlib support (nothing working yet)
7/3/98	I think we are about ready to release 0.2. Gregg sent some datetime code
	which appears to work great.  I added TDS 4.6 support (small changes 
	really) and tested all the byte order issues on an RS/6000.  Also, ctlib
	code will run the unittest.c and will compile all modules in sqsh 1.6, 
	however there are many missing functions before it will link!
7/10/98 Haven't been able to work on it lately (moved this week). Anyway,
        trying to add some functions to server.
7/13/98	Tom Poindexter made some changes to get sybtcl to work.
8/8/98	Haven't had much time lately (again), however some small stuff has 
	been fixed and the protocol version stuff has (mostly) been moved to a 
	runtime option. sybperl is supposedly running for simple stuff.
