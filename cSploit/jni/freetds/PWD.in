# UID: the username of a user to connect with
# PWD: the password for that user
# SRV: the symbolic server name from the freetds.conf (or interfaces) file. 
#      Note: if you use a hostname/IP here instead, freetds will attempt to 
#      connect using the compiletime default port (4000 for TDS 5.0, 1433 for 
#      4.2 or 7.0) which is usually not right.
# DB:  Database in which to create tables used in the tests.  For those new to 
#      Sybase or MS SQL server, there may be many database per server.  tempdb
#      is a good default choice if unsure.
