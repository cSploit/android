The programs in this directory test the db-lib routines.  Tests
that db-lib passes print "dblib okay for t000X.c" as the last line
of output and exit with a status of 0.  If the test does not print
that message for the last line of output it means that db-lib failed
that test.  

Some of the tests are designed to dump core if an error is detected.
This is to assist with post-mortem debugging of the dblib routines.

Run all tests with 'make check'.  The test programs read the 
'PWD' file in the root of the source tree to determine which
server to run the tests on and which account to login as.  

You will want to modify PWD accordingly.  

All unit tests are expected to pass on all servers and all 
operating systems.
