 * Replication Manager message format types.  These few format codes identify
 * enough information to describe, at the lowest level, how a message should be
 * read from the wire, including how much memory should be allocated to hold the
 * result.  (Often we want to allocate more than just enough to hold the
 * received bytes, if we know that we will need more during processing.)
 *
 * These values are transmitted between sites, even sites running differing BDB
 * versions.  Therefore, once assigned, the values are permanently "frozen".
 *
 * For example, in repmgr wire protocol version 1 the highest assigned message
 * type value was 3, for REPMGR_REP_MESSAGE.  Wire protocol version 2 added the
 * HEARTBEAT message type (4).
 *
 * New message types added in later versions always get new (higher) values.  We
 * still list them in alphabetical order, for ease of reference.  But this
 * generally does not correspond to numerical order.

/*
 * Repmgr keeps track of references to connection information (instances
 * of struct __repmgr_connection).  There are three kinds of places
 * connections may be found: (1) SITE->ref.conn, (2) SITE->sub_conns, and
 * (3) db_rep->connections.
 *
 * 1. SITE->ref.conn points to our connection with the listener process
 * running at the given site, if such a connection exists.  We may have
 * initiated the connection to the site ourselves, or we may have received
 * it as an incoming connection.  Once it is established there is very
 * little difference between those two cases.
 *
 * 2. SITE->sub_conns is a list of connections we have with subordinate
 * processes running at the given site.  There can be any number of these
 * connections, one per subordinate process.  Note that these connections
 * are always incoming: there's no way for us to initiate this kind of
 * connection because subordinate processes do not "listen".
 *
 * 3. The db_rep->connections list contains the references to any
 * connections that are not actively associated with any site (we
 * sometimes call these "orphans").  There are two times when this can
 * be:
 *
 *   a) When we accept an incoming connection, we don't know what site it
 *      comes from until we read the initial handshake message.
 *
 *   b) When an error occurs on a connection, we first mark it as DEFUNCT
 *      and stop using it.  Then, at a later, well-defined time, we close
 *      the connection's file descriptor and get rid of the connection
 *      struct.
 *
 * In light of the above, we can see that the following describes the
 * rules for how connections may be moved among these three kinds of
 * "places":
 *
 * - when we initiate an outgoing connection, we of course know what site
 *   it's going to be going to, and so we immediately put the pointer to
 *   the connection struct into SITE->ref.conn
 *
 * - when we accept an incoming connection, we don't immediately know
 *   whom it's from, so we have to put it on the orphans list
 *   (db_rep->connections).
 *
 * - (incoming, cont.) But as soon as we complete the initial "handshake"
 *   message exchange, we will know which site it's from and whether it's
 *   a subordinate or main connection.  At that point we remove it from
 *   db_rep->connections and either point to it by SITE->ref.conn, or add
 *   it to the SITE->sub_conns list.
 *
 * - (for any active connection) when an error occurs, we move the
 *   connection to the orphans list until we have a chance to close it.

/*
 * Most of the code in repmgr runs while holding repmgr's main mutex, which
 * resides in db_rep->mutex.  This mutex is owned by a single repmgr process,
 * and serializes access to the (large) critical sections among threads in the
 * process.  Unlike many other mutexes in DB, it is specifically coded as either
 * a POSIX threads mutex or a Win32 mutex.  Note that although it's a large
 * fraction of the code, it's a tiny fraction of the time: repmgr spends most of
 * its time in a call to select(), and as well a bit in calls into the Base
 * replication API.  All of those release the mutex.
 *     Access to repmgr's shared list of site addresses is protected by
 * another mutex: mtx_repmgr.  And, when changing space allocation for that site
 * list we conform to the convention of acquiring renv->mtx_regenv.  These are
 * less frequent of course.
 *     When it's necessary to acquire more than one of these mutexes, the
 * ordering priority (or "lock ordering protocol") is:
 *        db_rep->mutex (first)
 *        mtx_repmgr    (briefly)
 *        mtx_regenv    (last, and most briefly)
 *
 * There are also mutexes for app message "channels".  Each channel has a mutex,
 * which is used to serialize any connection re-establishment that may become
 * necessary during its lifetime (such as when a master changes).  This never
 * happens on a simple, specific-EID channel, but in other cases multiple app
 * threads could be making send_xxx() calls concurrently, and it would not do to
 * have two of them try to re-connect concurrently.
 *     When re-establishing a connection, the channel lock is held while
 * grabbing first the mtx_repmgr, and then the db_rep mutex (but not both
 * together).  I.e., we have:
 *        channel->mutex (first)
 *        [mtx_repmgr (very briefly)] and then [db_rep->mutex (very briefly)]
