/*
 * The functions in this module implement a simple wire protocol for
 * transmitting messages of various types.  Every message consists of a 9-byte
 * header followed by a body (though the body could be 0-length).  The header is
 * the marshaled form of the "msg_hdr" structure defined in repmgr.src.  The
 * interpretation of header fields depends on message type, and is defined in
 * repmgr.h.  But as a general principle, in all cases there is enough
 * information in the header for us to know the total size of the body, and the
 * total amount of memory we need to allocate for storing and processing the
 * message.
 */

/*
 * In sending a message, we first try to send it in-line, in the sending thread,
 * and without first copying the message, by using scatter/gather I/O, using
 * iovecs to point to the various pieces of the message.  If that all works
 * without blocking, that's optimal.
 *     If we find that, for a particular connection, we can't send without
 * blocking, then we must copy the message for sending later in the select()
 * thread.  In the course of doing that, we might as well "flatten" the message,
 * forming one single buffer, to simplify life.  Not only that, once we've gone
 * to the trouble of doing that, other sites to which we also want to send the
 * message (in the case of a broadcast), may as well take advantage of the
 * simplified structure also.
 *     The sending_msg structure below holds it all.  Note that this structure,
 * and the "flat_msg" structure, are allocated separately, because (1) the
 * flat_msg version is usually not needed; and (2) when a flat_msg is needed, it
 * will need to live longer than the wrapping sending_msg structure.
 *     Note that, for the broadcast case, where we're going to use this
 * repeatedly, the iovecs is a template that must be copied, since in normal use
 * the iovecs pointers and lengths get adjusted after every partial write.

 * Various threads write onto TCP/IP sockets, and an I/O error could occur at
 * any time.  However, only the dedicated "select()" thread may close the socket
 * file descriptor, because under POSIX we have to drop our mutex and then call
 * select() as two distinct (non-atomic) operations.
 *
 * To simplify matters, there is a single place in the select thread where we
 * close and clean up after any defunct connection.  Even if the I/O error
 * happens in the select thread we follow this convention.
 *
 * When an error occurs, we disable the connection (mark it defunct so that no
 * one else will try to use it, and so that the select thread will find it and
 * clean it up), and then usually take some additional recovery action: schedule
 * a connection retry for later, and possibly call for an election if it was a
 * connection to the master.  (This happens in the function
 * __repmgr_bust_connection.)  But sometimes we don't want to do the recovery
 * part; just the disabling part.
