    ADDING A NEW PACKET BUILDER, STATIC HEADER SIZE

Adding a new packet building module to libnet is usually pretty simple. The
following short document details how to add a packet builder to libnet for a
protocol that has a static header size. We'll use the Sebek protocol as an
example to walk through the process.

1) Make sure you have a good reference for the protocol in question. Be it an
   RFC or an official release doc from the author or vendor, you'll need
   something comprehensive. For Sebek, the comprehensive reference is here:
   http://project.honeynet.org.

2) Figure out how big the header is and add it to the top of libnet-headers.h:

#define LIBNET_SEBEK_H          0x30    /* sebek header:          48 bytes */   

3) Create the protocol header structure and add it to the end of
   libnet-headers.h. Take care to use POSIX datatypes to define all of your
   values. Structure naming conventions are more or less up to you. Since
   they're never exported to the user, it's not a big deal, but try to keep
   them short and descriptive. Convention is to add the symbolic constant 
   #defines above the structure members they apply to.

/*
 *  Sebek header
 *  Static header size: 48 bytes
 */
struct libnet_sebek_hdr
{
    u_int32_t magic;                /* identify packets that should be hidden */
    u_int16_t version;              /* protocol version, currently 1 */
#define SEBEK_PROTO_VERSION 1
    u_int16_t type;                 /* type of record */
#define SEBEK_TYPE_READ     0       /* currently, only read is supported */
#define SEBEK_TYPE_WRITE    1
    u_int32_t counter;              /* PDU counter */
    u_int32_t time_sec;             /* EPOCH timer */
    u_int32_t time_usec;            /* residual microseconds */
    u_int32_t pid;                  /* PID */
    u_int32_t uid;                  /* UID */
    u_int32_t fd;                   /* FD */
#define SEBEK_CMD_LENGTH   12
    u_int8_t cmd[SEBEK_CMD_LENGTH]; /* 12 first characters of the command */
    u_int32_t length;               /* PDU length */
};

3) Append a pblock identifier to the end of the list in libnet-structures.h.
   The ID number is not imporant as long as it is UNIQUE. As such, just find
   the last entry, append the new entry after it, and increase the pblock ID
   by one:

#define LIBNET_PBLOCK_SEBEK_H           0x3f    /* Sebek header */

4) Create your new builder file in src/. Adhere to the "libnet_build_PROTOCOL.c"
   convention. I recommend copying one of the existing builder modules and
   modifying it as you go.

}
    4) Add it to src/Makefile.am and then automake from the TLD.
    5) Test the shit out of it.
    6) Send it over to mike@infonexus.com.
